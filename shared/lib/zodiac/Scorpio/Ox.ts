  fullNarrative: `
You are emotional power wrapped in poise ‚Äî grounded, intuitive, fiercely loyal, and not interested in anything that doesn't feel *real*. You love with depth, protect with silence, and walk through life carrying both fire and structure in perfect balance.

You don't fall fast. You fall *intentionally*. You study people's energy before handing over your heart. And when you love? It's sacred. Steady. Devoted. You don't love loudly ‚Äî but you love with everything.

In love, you're deeply loyal, emotionally wise, and quietly intense. You give through your presence, your protection, and the emotional stability you offer without ever needing to be asked. You crave connection that's honest, grounded, and emotionally mutual. You won't stay where there's chaos, guessing, or games.

You don't ask twice. You don't explain your standards. And if someone mishandles your heart, you remove access. Not dramatically. Completely. With clarity and peace.

In work, you're structured, dependable, and often a quiet force behind powerful transformation. You build slowly, but everything you touch holds. You don't do things halfway ‚Äî and you don't work for praise. You work for *purpose*.

In friendships and family, you are the silent guardian. The one who holds everyone together, remembers the small things, and offers stability others rely on ‚Äî often without realizing it. But if you're taken for granted, your energy disappears long before your words do.

In love, you're intense and principled. You listen more than you speak, act more than you promise, and show up in the moments that matter ‚Äî without needing to be asked. You crave a bond that's emotionally safe, spiritually aligned, and free of emotional games.
