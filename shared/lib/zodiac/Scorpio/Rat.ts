You are silence with substance â€” emotionally powerful, highly intuitive, and fiercely loyal to the few who earn your trust. You don't give yourself away easily. You observe. You assess. You love with depth but demand *truth* and *intention* in return.

You're magnetic, but guarded. People are drawn to your presence without knowing why â€” because your mystery isn't empty, it's *earned*. You carry emotional intensity behind still eyes, and when you love, you *love like it's sacred* â€” but only once your boundaries say it's safe.

In love, you're fiercely devoted, sensual, and incredibly strategic with your heart. You don't fall fast â€” but when you do, it's all-consuming. You crave emotional honesty, shared purpose, and a partner who respects your fire *without trying to control it*.

But if trust is broken or you feel emotionally betrayed? You disappear. Not with a bang, but with finality. You don't beg. You don't explain. You *move on* â€” and your silence is unforgettable.

In work, you're sharp, resourceful, and quietly ambitious. You thrive where intuition, loyalty, and precision matter. You don't need credit. You need *results*. And when you lead, it's often from behind the scenes â€” but with total control.

In friendships and family, you're deeply loyal and highly protective. You see more than you say. You hold secrets like armor. And when someone crosses a line? You never return to who you were with them before â€” no matter how kind you remain.

  fullNarrative: `
You are stillness with teeth â€” observant, emotionally powerful, and built for intensity few can handle. You love with caution, commit with focus, and move with the kind of emotional calculation that's more protection than performance.

People underestimate your silence. You're not cold â€” you're *composed*. You don't give your heart easily, and when you do, it's with total presence. But if someone betrays your loyalty or threatens your peace? They won't hear anger â€” they'll feel absence. And it will echo.

In love, you're fiercely protective, deeply sensual, and quietly devoted. You don't want small talk â€” you want soul talk. You crave connection that respects your emotional rhythm and meets your loyalty with truth, not excuses.

You're romantic in ways that are subtle but unforgettable â€” through your consistency, your presence, your protection. But if someone breaks your trust, there are no warnings. Just closed doors. Permanently.

At work, you're focused, strategic, and quietly competitive. You don't need to be seen â€” you need to *succeed*. You thrive in environments where integrity, planning, and emotional discretion matter. You don't play politics â€” you play to win, with principles.

In friendships and family, you are loyal, insightful, and protective. You don't say much, but you *know everything*. You offer safety â€” until your boundaries are crossed. And when they are, you don't retaliate. You remove yourself completely.
