  fullNarrative: `
You are poetry with armor â€” gentle in your energy, intense in your loyalty, and protective of your peace in a world that often misunderstands stillness for softness. You don't love loudly â€” but you love *completely*. When you care, you care with precision, with silence, and with the kind of depth that doesn't need an audience.

You're emotionally sensitive, but rarely chaotic. You read energy with intuition and feel things long before others do â€” yet you often keep your emotions tucked beneath calm observation. You give your love with intention and loyalty, but only when someone proves they can meet your stillness with safety.

In love, you're romantic, soulful, and quietly devoted. You offer comfort, protection, and emotional loyalty that runs deep. You don't chase chaos. You want peace, realness, and a partner who understands the quiet power of someone who chooses love slowly, but forever.

If someone betrays your loyalty or disrespects your emotional rhythm, you don't lash out â€” you *withdraw*. Fully. Without warning. Because once your trust is gone, there is no performance â€” just presence retracted.

In work, you're thoughtful, disciplined, and creatively gifted. You thrive in emotionally aware, aesthetically sensitive, or mission-driven environments. You often become the silent pillar â€” the person everyone leans on, without realizing how much you carry.

In friendship and family, you're protective, supportive, and fiercely loyal in subtle ways. You remember what matters. You hold space for people without demanding anything back â€” but when your care is taken for granted, your silence says more than your words ever will.

  fullNarrative: `
You are softness carved from strength â€” quietly powerful, emotionally intuitive, and loyal in a way that few people ever truly *earn*. You offer love that is gentle but guarded, nurturing but discerning. And when you commit, it's not out of convenience â€” it's sacred.

You don't fall fast. You fall *deep*. You give your energy to those who move with care, speak with purpose, and match the emotional depth you live by. You are tender â€” but never fragile. You lead with intuition and protect your peace like it's your birthright.

In love, you are loyal, emotionally present, and softly sensual. You want a partner who sees your grace as strength, not vulnerability. You give through quiet care, small details, and steady presence. But if someone breaks your trust or disrespects your heart? You walk. No explanation. No echo.

You're drawn to soulful connection â€” a love that grows slowly, honestly, and safely. You don't want chaos. You want consistency. You want someone who knows how to hold your emotional world without trying to control it.

In work, you're intuitive, creative, and detail-oriented. You thrive in environments that value empathy, emotional intelligence, and aesthetics. You're the one people turn to when they want calm clarity â€” not chaos.

In friendships and family, you're nurturing, thoughtful, and incredibly loyal. You hold space for others with grace and quiet insight. But when your love is taken for granted, your emotional presence begins to fade â€” not out of bitterness, but self-protection.
