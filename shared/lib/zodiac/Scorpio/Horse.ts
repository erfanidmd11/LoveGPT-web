  fullNarrative: `
You are fire behind a locked door â€” passionate, emotionally rich, unpredictable in rhythm, but unwavering in loyalty once you commit. You don't give your heart easily, but when you do, it's all-consuming. Purposeful. Protective. *Permanent.*

You love fiercely â€” but only when it's safe to stay free. You want connection that inspires, not controls. You need passion with peace. Depth with movement. A partner who respects your solitude but knows how to *reach you anyway*.

In love, you're protective, expressive, and all-or-nothing. You give everything when it feels right â€” and nothing when it feels forced. You don't do shallow. You don't do half-love. You're intense, loyal, and emotionally precise when it counts.

But you fear stagnation. When love feels too still or emotionally heavy without clarity, you may retreat â€” not out of disloyalty, but self-preservation. You need space *and* commitment. A relationship that lets you stay wild â€” *while staying rooted*.

In work, you're driven, intuitive, and powerful under pressure. You thrive in roles that demand both fire and focus â€” where independence is respected and performance matches your passion. You don't want to follow. You want to *build*.

In family and friendship, you're deeply loyal, protective, and emotionally generous in your own rhythm. You may seem emotionally distant at times, but when someone earns your trust? You'd walk through fire for them. Quietly. Completely. No announcement needed.

  fullNarrative: `
You are fire wrapped in intuition â€” fierce, passionate, and emotionally raw in the most beautiful way. You don't ask for permission to feel. You *are* the permission. You love hard, move fast, and demand truth in every form â€” because you don't do halfway.

In love, you're loyal, deeply sensual, and wildly protective. You'll give someone your world â€” but only if they meet you with equal depth, equal effort, and the emotional clarity you crave. You want a partner who won't tame your wild â€” but will *ride with it*, hold it, respect it.

You give affection with fire and protect your peace like it's a kingdom. If your loyalty is betrayed or your spirit stifled, you won't explain â€” you'll *vanish*. With grace. With finality. You don't fight for attention â€” you move toward alignment.

You need passion *and* independence. You want to be seen in your softness without being asked to shrink your flame. You crave depth, devotion, and someone who can hold your intensity without collapsing under it.

In work, you're driven, independent, and emotionally sharp. You thrive in spaces where vision, speed, and emotional intelligence are assets. You lead by example â€” and you never stay in systems that undervalue your voice.

In family and friendship, you're protective, fiercely loyal, and surprisingly tender beneath your power. You'll fight for the people you love â€” but if your care is taken for granted, you shut the door without noise. You don't return to what ignored your value.
