  fullNarrative: `
You are stillness with substance â€” quietly powerful, emotionally precise, and magnetic in a way that never begs for attention. You don't chase â€” you *observe*. You don't fall fast â€” you *feel fully*, and only act when trust and alignment meet.

You lead with calm intensity. You protect what you love. You offer loyalty as a sacred contract â€” and expect the same in return. You're sensual, grounded, and emotionally rich beneath a cool exterior. And when you choose to let someone in? It's deliberate. Life-altering. Permanent.

In love, you're disciplined, romantic in detail, and fiercely devoted when your heart feels emotionally safe. You show affection through presence, attention, and your unmatched ability to create emotional security without overexposing your feelings.

But when trust is broken? You don't argue â€” you vanish. Your silence is a closing door. One that rarely reopens.

You crave connection that feels clean, honest, and strong. You don't need chaos â€” you need clarity. You want a partner who can hold their own energy and meet yours without fear or manipulation.

At work, you're strategic, focused, and excellent in environments where discretion and emotional intelligence are assets. You don't like to waste energy â€” but when you commit, you bring consistent brilliance behind the scenes.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, quiet, and deeply protective. You offer presence, solutions, and emotional safety â€” but only when that energy is respected. If it's not, you pull back completely.

  fullNarrative: `
You are silence with sharp edges â€” magnetic, emotionally complex, and unwilling to water yourself down to be more "digestible." You love with full presence, protect with calculated grace, and offer loyalty like a sacred vow â€” never casually, and never without depth.

You feel everything â€” and speak only when it matters. You're discerning in love, protective of your peace, and strategic with your vulnerability. You observe. You remember. And once you decide someone has earned your trust, you offer a devotion that's deeply sensual, soulfully anchored, and quietly fierce.

In love, you're deeply loyal, emotionally intelligent, and subtly intense. You don't waste time on shallow dynamics. You want someone who brings safety, presence, clarity â€” and has the depth to sit in your stillness without trying to solve it.

You are romantic in your own language: through energy, thoughtfulness, and the kind of quiet care that people feel more than they can explain. You want a love that makes you feel respected, not controlled. If someone plays with your emotions or betrays your trust, your departure is elegant, but absolute.

At work, you're driven, strategic, and quietly influential. You lead from behind the curtain â€” and often set the entire tone of the room without saying a word. You don't need the spotlight. You need the results.

In friendship and family, you're fiercely protective, intuitive, and deeply present â€” until your care is dismissed or taken for granted. If that happens, you pull back, rebuild in silence, and never let someone that close again.
