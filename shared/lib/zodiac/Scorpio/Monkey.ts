  fullNarrative: `
You are laughter with a secret â€” clever, observant, and emotionally sharper than people expect. You disarm with charm, but underneath the playfulness is a deeply loyal man who watches everything before revealing what matters.

You flirt with life. You ask the deep questions. You keep people on their toes â€” and when you love, it's never casual. You fall hard, but only when it feels like someone sees past the sparkle and gets to the structure underneath.

In love, you're romantic, curious, and fiercely committed once someone earns your trust. You may act lighthearted, but your loyalty runs deep. You show love through presence, energy, and protection â€” even if your vulnerability arrives a bit later.

You're strategic in how you love. You want emotional safety, but you test it before asking for it. If someone plays games or lacks depth, you walk â€” not dramatically, but cleanly. You don't do chaos for fun. You do connection that feels true.

At work, you're creative, fast-thinking, and emotionally savvy. You thrive in environments that reward intellect, charisma, and innovation. You lead best when you're free to move â€” and when people understand that your mind never stops refining what's next.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, insightful, and often the emotional translator â€” picking up on what people *mean*, not just what they say. But if you're emotionally drained or disrespected, you distance. Not loudly. Just... completely.

  fullNarrative: `
You are charm with a secret pulse â€” playful, clever, emotionally rich, and wildly loyal once you feel safe. You flirt with the surface, but your heart lives in the depths. People often meet your humor first â€” and only later realize how deeply you were reading the room all along.

You are observant, intuitive, and disarming. You know how to ask questions that matter and how to love without giving it all away on day one. In love, you're flirtatious, passionate, and fiercely devoted once someone passes the silent tests you never announce.

You don't fall for words â€” you fall for *consistency*. For presence. For someone who laughs with you *and* sees through you. You want a partner who understands your fire, respects your freedom, and doesn't mistake your independence for indifference.

You love with detail and energy, but guard your emotional world with sharp intuition. If someone plays games or fails to match your depth, you step back â€” gracefully, but fully. Your goodbye is rarely loud â€” but always permanent.

At work, you're creative, quick-thinking, and emotionally savvy. You thrive in environments that value imagination and interpersonal intelligence. You're often the quiet power behind ideas others claim â€” and the one they turn to when things fall apart.

In family and friendship, you're fiercely loyal, protective, and surprisingly deep beneath your spontaneity. You support with humor, with insight, and with subtle acts of devotion that most people never even see coming â€” but always feel.
