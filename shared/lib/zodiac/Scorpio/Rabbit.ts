  fullNarrative: `
You are silence with gravity â€” emotionally sensitive, artistically inclined, and deeply loyal to love that makes you feel seen *and* safe. You don't open easily, but when you do, your devotion runs deep, steady, and quietly fierce.

You don't need to be loud to be powerful. Your presence is felt in the pause, in the consistency, in the way you show up without making it a performance. You speak through action, protection, and the kind of emotional awareness that's more instinct than strategy.

In love, you're romantic, nurturing, and introspective. You crave emotional closeness â€” but only in safe spaces. You give with care, softness, and quiet loyalty. You feel deeply, but rarely share quickly. Trust is earned. And once you give it, you expect it to be *honored*.

You don't handle betrayal lightly. You don't rage. You *retreat*. And when you go, it's complete. No warning. No return. Because your energy is sacred, and your love is not something you give out just to be tolerated.

In work, you're reflective, disciplined, and emotionally intuitive. You thrive in creative or service-based spaces â€” anywhere your insight and sensitivity are seen as gifts, not weaknesses. You're consistent, thoughtful, and often the quiet anchor in chaotic environments.

In friendships and family, you're the listener, the nurturer, and the one who notices when someone's energy is off â€” even if they don't say it. But if your emotional presence is taken for granted, you vanish quietly. Not out of bitterness â€” but protection.

  fullNarrative: `
You are softness wrapped in steel â€” gentle, emotionally wise, and deeply protective of the peace you've built around your heart. You don't fall in love easily â€” but when you do, it's all-consuming, sacred, and fiercely loyal.

You are observant, intuitive, and slow to trust â€” not out of fear, but *intention*. You've learned to watch first, feel second, and speak last. But beneath that calm exterior is a woman of profound emotional depth, creative fire, and quiet power.

In love, you're romantic, nurturing, and intuitive. You give with care, tenderness, and consistent presence. You don't need flashy gestures â€” you need *real ones*. You want soul, truth, emotional maturity. You crave a partner who respects your silence and understands your storms.

When betrayed or disrespected, you don't raise your voice. You raise your standards. And once you decide someone can't hold your truth? You disappear â€” not out of cruelty, but clarity.

In work, you're thoughtful, emotionally intelligent, and quietly creative. You thrive in roles that allow you to serve, build, or express beauty â€” and you lead through stillness and subtle direction.

In friendships and family, you are the emotional anchor â€” the one who holds space, remembers, supports, and *feels everything*. You don't say much, but you give everything. And when your care isn't respected? You go quiet â€” and that silence speaks volumes.
