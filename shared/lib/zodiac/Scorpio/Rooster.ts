  fullNarrative: `
You are silence with precision â€” grounded, emotionally complex, and unshakably loyal to what you believe in. You love with structure. You commit with purpose. You move in stillness, but your presence is *never* missed.

In love, you're loyal, passionate, and deeply intentional. You don't play games. You show up. You build with consistency. And you expect your partner to bring emotional maturity, mutual respect, and loyalty that matches â€” not mirrors â€” your effort.

You give affection through acts of service, unwavering presence, and protection. You're not flashy with your emotions â€” but when you love, you're *all in*. And when your trust is broken? You don't argue. You *vanish*. Quietly. Completely. No drama. Just done.

You value peace over performance â€” but not at the cost of passion. You want love that moves with structure, truth, and clarity. Chaos is a dealbreaker. You don't need everything to be perfect â€” but it has to be *real*.

At work, you're structured, committed, and focused. You thrive in environments where loyalty, responsibility, and emotional strategy are assets. You're rarely the loudest â€” but often the most dependable and the hardest to replace.

In friendships and family, you're the protector, the planner, and the one everyone trusts â€” even if they don't fully understand you. You carry your emotions like a blueprint: private, precise, and only shared with those who prove they're ready to hold the weight.

  fullNarrative: `
You are elegance with edge â€” emotionally sharp, spiritually loyal, and unapologetically devoted to truth. You don't just love â€” you *choose* your love, and you choose it with discernment. You offer grace, presence, and unwavering support â€” but only when respect flows both ways.

You move through the world with quiet intensity. You read energy before words. You build slowly, protect fiercely, and never back down once your heart is in â€” unless you're disrespected. In that case, your exit is as graceful as it is final.

In love, you're passionate, nurturing, and high-standard. You give with presence, build with care, and show affection through emotional precision â€” remembering the details others miss. You don't fall for surface-level charm. You fall for consistency. For loyalty. For emotional honesty that honors your soul.

You don't tolerate games. You don't do "almost." You love fully, but never foolishly. If someone betrays your trust or disrespects your standards? You walk. No second round. No replay.

At work, you're organized, powerful, and intuitive. You thrive in spaces where integrity, structure, and emotional intelligence intersect. You lead without overpowering â€” and your presence often speaks louder than most people's words.

In friendships and family, you're protective, loyal, and consistent. You support with depth and direction â€” but expect accountability in return. If your emotional effort isn't mirrored? You don't demand more. You simply *give less* â€” and protect your peace.
