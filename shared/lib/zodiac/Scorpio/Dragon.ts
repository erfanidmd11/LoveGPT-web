  fullNarrative: `
You are thunder with discipline â€” emotionally deep, magnetically powerful, and wired to protect what you build with fierce devotion. You don't give your heart often â€” but when you do, it's sacred. Fully present. Fully committed. No distractions. No apologies.

You lead in love the way you lead in life â€” with intensity, focus, and clarity. You want truth, not fluff. Soul connection, not surface charm. When you love, it's not casual. It's consuming. It's purposeful. And it's protected with everything you are.

But if someone disrespects your loyalty? You walk. No drama. No explanation. Just doors that never reopen.

In love, you're sensual, protective, and emotionally disciplined. You don't overshare â€” but you over-deliver. You want a partner who understands the power behind your quiet, the loyalty behind your intensity, and the tenderness beneath your fire.

At work, you're commanding, intuitive, and unstoppable when aligned with purpose. You're driven by impact, not applause. You see beyond surface solutions and lead with a level of emotional depth that keeps you two steps ahead.

In family and friendship, you're the protector and the pillar. You take loyalty seriously â€” and expect it in return. You don't tolerate emotional games, and when your trust is broken, your presence disappears like a shadow at sunrise.

  fullNarrative: `
You are emotional fire with purpose â€” radiant, unshakable, and unapologetically true to your soul. You don't *do* small. Not in love. Not in life. Not in loyalty. You lead with power and presence, and you don't offer your heart lightly â€” only to those who've proven they can hold it without dropping the flame.

In love, you're deeply loyal, emotionally intense, and fiercely protective. You crave connection that feels *sacred* â€” not performative. You want passion, truth, respect, and a partner who doesn't flinch when your soul starts speaking louder than your words.

You're not afraid to walk alone. You love deeply, but if disrespected or undervalued, your goodbye is swift â€” and permanent. You don't beg. You don't repeat yourself. You *rise*.

You express love through action, energy, and emotional presence. You don't say "I love you" a hundred times a day â€” you *show* it in the way you stand beside your partner, fight for their peace, and demand mutual growth.

At work, you're a powerhouse. Visionary, assertive, emotionally intuitive, and determined to build a legacy â€” not just a resume. You lead with quiet fire and expect excellence from yourself and those around you.

In friendship and family, you're loyal, direct, and protective. You may be slow to trust, but when someone earns their place in your world, they get a warrior who shows up fully. But once that trust is broken? You won't look back.
