You are thunder in stillness â€” intense, fiercely loyal, emotionally rich, and impossible to forget. You lead with presence, love with depth, and guard your energy like a sacred flame. You're not just powerful â€” you're *potent*. And anyone who earns your loyalty earns a kind of protection that goes beyond logic.

In love, you're all in. You're not here for surface-level or soft-spoken interest. You crave soul-level fire â€” emotional truth, mutual obsession, and someone who doesn't just love your chaos, but respects the roots of it. You're romantic in ways that are wild, unfiltered, and consuming â€” but only for the one who *matches your intensity*.

You don't forgive betrayal easily. You don't fake feelings. And you don't chase people who didn't recognize the value of your loyalty. When you're done, you're *done* â€” completely, without drama, but with undeniable finality.

You give through your presence, your passion, and your willingness to fight for what matters. But you also need emotional safety â€” a place where your vulnerability isn't just allowed, but *honored*.

At work, you're visionary, driven, and unapologetically bold. You excel in high-pressure roles, leadership, and mission-driven pursuits. People follow your energy â€” even when they don't understand it. You command respect because you *move with purpose*.

In friendship and family, you're protective, supportive, and the emotional pulse behind the scenes. You may not say much, but when you care â€” it shows. Loudly. And if someone hurts someone you love? There's no second warning.

  fullNarrative: `
You are wildfire wrapped in velvet â€” passionate, protective, emotionally layered, and loyal to the core. You don't just love â€” you *devour* what feels real, and you burn down anything that feels fake. You demand honesty, intensity, and emotional reciprocity â€” no more, no less.

In love, you're magnetic, expressive, and all-consuming once trust is earned. You don't fall easily, but when you do, it's not halfway. You offer your partner full presence, emotional depth, fierce loyalty â€” and expect the same in return. You want a connection that *feels like truth* â€” not just romance.

But you are no stranger to solitude. If someone disrespects your energy, betrays your loyalty, or tries to tame your fire, you walk. Proudly. Without regret. Because your love isn't desperate â€” it's *disciplined*. It's sacred. It's not for sale.

You crave a partner who can sit in the fire with you â€” someone who doesn't flinch when you get quiet, intense, or unapologetically raw. Someone who doesn't try to control your independence, but honors it â€” because they know you stay by *choice*, not because you *need* to.

In work, you're dynamic, focused, and emotionally driven. You lead through passion, emotional intelligence, and a no-nonsense attitude. You don't just build careers â€” you build *legacies*.

In family and friendship, you're protective, devoted, and sharp. You don't need a crowd â€” but your inner circle gets your all. And if someone violates your trust, there's no round two. Your grace is deep, but your boundaries are *iron*.
