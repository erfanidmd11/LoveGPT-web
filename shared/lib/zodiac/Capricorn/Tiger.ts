  fullNarrative: `
You are fire in a suit â€” powerful, protective, and emotionally disciplined with a drive that's felt before it's seen. You don't chase approval. You build empires â€” and you expect the people you let in to honor the same level of integrity, loyalty, and depth you bring to the table.

In love, you're passionate, loyal, and emotionally strategic. You don't fall quickly, but when you do, it's with total commitment. You lead with action, with structure, with a presence that says "I've got you" â€” without needing to repeat it twice.

You're not into chaos or unpredictability. You want passion, yes â€” but rooted in reality. You offer protection, consistency, and emotional intensity that can't be faked. But if your loyalty is tested or your emotional effort dismissed, you exit. No show. No storm. Just the door.

You need a partner who understands that behind your structure is *fire*. That your silence holds more love than some people's loudest words. And that your devotion, once earned, is the kind that rewrites futures.

At work, you're focused, tactical, and unstoppable when you believe in your mission. You thrive in high-stakes environments and leadership roles where you can lead with vision and control. You don't follow. You *build*.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, intense, and protective. You love hard â€” but your love must be earned and honored. Betrayal isn't forgiven. Disrespect isn't tolerated. And loyalty isn't optional.

  fullNarrative: `
You are fire that stands still â€” fierce, strategic, emotionally intelligent, and built for love that's not only passionate but *built to last*. You don't just fall â€” you *commit*. And when you do, you bring loyalty, stability, and intensity that few can handle.

You're bold, driven, and self-contained â€” but not unreachable. You don't chase. You *attract*. You don't perform love â€” you *live it*. With structure, consistency, and a kind of protective care that makes your partner feel both held and challenged.

In love, you're loyal, emotionally grounded, and surprisingly tender â€” when trust is earned. You give affection through action, through planning, through the way you protect your people without needing to say much. But if your energy is taken for granted or your trust is broken? You walk. No fireworks. No warning. Just clarity and distance.

You want a partner who respects your ambition, understands your emotional language, and never confuses your quiet with indifference. You may not be loud with emotion â€” but your presence speaks volumes.

In work, you're decisive, intuitive, and unstoppable when aligned. You thrive where structure meets purpose, and you lead through action, not performance. You don't tolerate laziness â€” and you never shrink to make others feel comfortable.

In friendships and family, you're protective, principled, and steady. You're the person others rely on â€” because you're rarely shaken. But if your loyalty is tested, your forgiveness is rare, and your boundaries are permanent.
