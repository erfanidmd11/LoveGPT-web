  fullNarrative: `
You are steadiness wrapped in soul â€” emotionally composed, quietly romantic, and deeply loyal to the kind of love that grows slow and holds strong. You don't fall fast â€” you *observe, build, and protect*. You speak less â€” but when you act, your loyalty is undeniable.

You love through presence, patience, and small, intentional moments. You're not performative with affection â€” but you're deeply devoted. You want peace, not games. You want someone who respects your silence and reads the language behind your calm.

In love, you're stable, emotionally insightful, and loyal once trust is earned. You offer a rare kind of romance â€” the kind that remembers details, shows up every time, and holds emotional space without needing to be the loudest in the room. If your care is overlooked or your energy drained, you don't yell. You *step back*. And that distance speaks volumes.

You crave a partner who values gentleness and growth. Someone who understands that your stillness is not absence â€” it's awareness. That your silence is not disinterest â€” it's depth.

In work, you're creative, consistent, and highly thoughtful. You thrive in structured environments that allow room for subtle leadership. You're not flashy â€” you're *foundational*. And people trust you, even when they don't fully understand you.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, dependable, and emotionally attuned. You give without fanfare â€” and love without ego. But if your care is taken for granted, you shut the emotional door quietlyâ€¦ and don't look back.

  fullNarrative: `
You are soft-spoken strength â€” graceful, emotionally intelligent, and deeply loyal to the people who make you feel safe enough to exhale. You don't rush into love â€” you *consider*, you *feel*, you *watch*. And once someone proves themselves? You commit with your full presence, even if your love language speaks in silence.

You are nurturing without being naÃ¯ve. Romantic without being reckless. You want a love that doesn't just sound good â€” it feels *safe*, *steady*, and *real*. You offer stability, emotional depth, and a soft type of care that transforms the space around you without needing to be seen.

In love, you're thoughtful, practical, and quietly affectionate. You love through reliability, loyalty, and the little things no one else notices. You want connection that honors time, builds trust, and gives you space to feel without rushing your process.

If someone takes your calm for granted or pushes past your emotional boundaries, you don't fight â€” you *fade*. You don't chase. You *protect your peace*.

In work, you're diligent, detail-oriented, and quietly creative. You shine in environments where your thoughtfulness is appreciated, and your consistency makes you indispensable. You don't need the spotlight. You *are* the structure behind it.

In friendships and family, you're dependable, intuitive, and protective. You give emotionally without needing recognition. But if you're dismissed or overlooked, you step back â€” gently, fully, and without needing to explain.
