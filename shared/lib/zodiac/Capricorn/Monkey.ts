  fullNarrative: `
You are intellect with intention â€” sharp-minded, disciplined, quietly ambitious, and emotionally self-possessed. You move with purpose, not performance. In love, you don't chase chaos. You court *clarity* â€” but with charm and calculated depth.

In love, you are discerning, playful beneath the surface, and loyal once trust is built. You won't open up just because someone's curious â€” they need to be *capable* of understanding you. You want a partner who can match your wit, navigate your intensity, and honor your quiet need for space and structure.

You love through mental engagement and emotional steadiness. You offer support through solutions. Affection through action. And while you may not wear your heart on your sleeve, your loyalty runs deep â€” deeper than most expect. But if your intelligence is insulted or your emotional rhythm disrespected? You don't argue. You *elevate* â€” away.

In your career, you are innovative and focused. You blend logic with vision, charm with strategy. You move ahead not by noise â€” but by knowing exactly where to place your energy. You're a long-game player in a world of short-term thinkers.

With friends and family, you're loyal, observant, and selectively vulnerable. You don't trust easily, but once someone proves worthy, you invest with patience and precision. You'd rather have one real connection than ten performative ones.

  fullNarrative: `
You are logic with grace â€” witty, disciplined, emotionally composed, and endlessly strategic. You read rooms like chessboards, people like puzzles, and love like a story that needs depth, not decoration.

In love, you're clever, observant, and quietly intense. You don't fall fast â€” you *assess*. Your affection is earned through intellectual stimulation and consistent behavior. You crave a partner who sees beyond your polished exterior â€” someone who respects your space, matches your ambition, and invites your playfulness without ever compromising your standards.

You love through insight, loyalty, and support. You listen for what's not said. You protect your heart with humor and analysis â€” not because you lack emotion, but because you *feel deeply*. And if you're ever emotionally disrespected or underestimated? You won't explode â€” you'll *detach*. Smoothly. Silently. Strategically.

In work, you're brilliant, focused, and agile. You lead with subtle strength, blending long-term vision with tactical action. You may come off reserved, but your mind is always moving. You're not loud â€” you're *lethal*. In the best way.

In friendship and family, you're discerning and loyal. You give advice that cuts through the noise. You're that rare kind of woman who balances nurturing with sharp boundaries â€” and never needs to explain them twice.
