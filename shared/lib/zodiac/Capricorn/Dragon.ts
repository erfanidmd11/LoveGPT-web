  fullNarrative: `
You are power with a plan â€” disciplined, bold, and emotionally grounded in a way that turns vision into action and loyalty into a lifestyle. You don't play small. In love or in life, you want something *real* â€” something worth building, protecting, and fighting for.

In love, you're intensely loyal, protective, and emotionally disciplined. You love through leadership, presence, and unwavering consistency. You're not about grand gestures for show â€” you're about devotion that lasts long after the words fade.

You want a partner who respects your rhythm, values your vision, and doesn't flinch when you reveal the fire behind your structure. You can be emotionally reserved â€” but not because you don't feel. Because you feel *everything*, and only a few will ever truly earn access.

When trust is broken or loyalty questioned, you don't rage â€” you *exit*. Quietly. Completely. And you don't look back.

At work, you're a builder, a powerhouse, a quiet storm of strategy and execution. You lead with integrity and drive. You don't chase success â€” you *create it*. And you won't stop until the foundation is unshakable.

In friendships and family, you're deeply loyal, protective, and dependable. You don't need a crowd. You need *consistency*. You give without conditions â€” but if your loyalty is dismissed, your presence disappears without explanation.

  fullNarrative: `
You are structure with fire inside â€” poised, loyal, emotionally intelligent, and unwavering in your truth. You don't beg to be chosen. You *choose*. You don't speak often â€” but when you do, it carries weight. And when you love, it's not impulsive â€” it's *earned*, *intentional*, and *unbreakable*.

In love, you're emotionally measured, powerfully present, and deeply loyal â€” but only once someone proves they're grounded enough to walk beside you. You protect your softness with silence, and lead with strength that's built from self-respect â€” not ego.

You give love through structure, dependability, and deep protection. You won't tolerate emotional instability or performative affection. You want truth, integrity, vision â€” and if someone threatens your peace? You *exit*. Quietly. Completely. With no second round.

You crave a partner who sees behind your armor â€” someone who respects your independence but still knows how to show up for your soul. You don't need to be saved. You need to be *seen* â€” and respected.

In work, you are determined, magnetic, and often the quiet powerhouse in the room. You thrive in structured environments where long-term impact and visionary thinking are respected. You don't need recognition â€” your presence *demands it*.

In friendships and family, you're protective, loyal, and grounded. You give more than you say. But if your effort is overlooked, your love doesn't fade â€” it disappears. And you never come back the same.
