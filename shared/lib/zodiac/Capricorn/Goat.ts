  fullNarrative: `
You are calm with conviction â€” steady, insightful, emotionally layered, and quietly powerful. You don't shout your presence â€” you *embody* it. In love, you move deliberately, because what you seek isn't fleeting. It's *forever*.

In love, you are steady and discerning. You give your trust in layers â€” not because you're guarded, but because you *value it*. You don't fall easily, but when you do, it's with full intent. You want a partner who understands stillness doesn't mean stagnation â€” it means emotional depth is building under the surface.

You love through stability. Through subtle actions, thoughtful care, and unwavering presence. You may not always articulate your emotions, but you express them through consistency, effort, and quiet loyalty. If your respect is lost or your emotional boundaries are crossed, you won't raise your voice â€” you'll *reclaim your distance*.

In work, you're strategic, focused, and enduring. You don't rush â€” you refine. Your ambition is rarely boastful, but your results speak volumes. You are a natural builder â€” of businesses, legacies, and safe emotional spaces.

With family and friendship, you are loyal and rooted. You value tradition, but not at the cost of truth. Your connections are meaningful â€” and few by design. You don't spread yourself thin. You offer quality over quantity â€” always.

 ],
  fullNarrative: `
You are stillness with strength â€” emotionally wise, quietly ambitious, deeply loyal, and structured in both mind and heart. You don't rush love. You *study* it. You let it reveal itself slowly, with grace and with proof.

In love, you are cautious, elegant, and emotionally deliberate. You give of yourself slowly, because you understand the sacredness of true connection. You crave depth â€” not drama. Presence â€” not performance. You need a partner who respects your inner world and never confuses your calm with passivity.

You love through quiet gestures. Through loyalty, consistency, and deep emotional intuition. You hold space with dignity, and you expect the same in return. But if you feel taken for granted or emotionally unsafe? You don't fight â€” you *fade*. Fully. Peacefully. With no return trip.

In your career, you're structured, visionary, and deeply reliable. You set standards high â€” not to compete, but to stay aligned with your inner truth. You are never careless with your time, your love, or your energy.

With friends and family, you're nurturing, protective, and intentional. You don't do surface-level connection â€” and you're not afraid to be the one who holds it all together when needed. But you're learning that you deserve support too.
