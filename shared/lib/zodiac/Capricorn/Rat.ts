  fullNarrative: `
You are precision wrapped in patience â€” observant, strategic, emotionally disciplined, and quietly loyal to the people who prove they're worth your time. You don't rush. You *build*. You love with depth, but only once someone earns their way through your armor.

You aren't loud about your intentions â€” but they're always clear. You lead in silence, love with structure, and commit only when trust has been tested, not just promised.

In love, you're loyal, protective, and emotionally steady. You don't play games. You don't offer your heart easily. But when you do? You're consistent, grounded, and quietly devoted. You believe in love that makes sense â€” love that shows up, works hard, and *lasts*.

You're not one for emotional chaos or unpredictable energy. You want connection that's stable, intelligent, and real. If your peace is disrupted or your loyalty taken for granted, you don't fight â€” you *withdraw*. Quietly. Permanently.

At work, you're efficient, intelligent, and tireless. You excel in environments that value long-term thinking and emotional restraint. You're a builder of systems, not a chaser of applause.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, structured, and protective â€” but not overly expressive. You support quietly, and you expect respect in return. If trust is broken, your forgiveness is rare â€” and your energy is never given twice.

  fullNarrative: `
You are elegance with armor â€” composed, intuitive, and emotionally deliberate. You move with purpose. You love with precision. And you only open your heart to those who prove they know what to do with it.

You're emotionally intelligent, but you don't overshare. You observe first. You test gently. And when you feel emotionally secure, you offer loyalty, warmth, and unwavering presence. You want love that is built â€” not rushed. You want someone who's solid, not loud. Safe, not clingy. Confident enough to handle your standards, and grounded enough to *earn your trust*.

In love, you're protective, dependable, and loyal once your guard is down. You love in quiet, meaningful ways â€” not through big displays, but through your presence, your commitment, and the way you *stay*. If someone disrespects that, you don't argue. You simply *restructure your boundaries*. And once you do, they don't shift again.

You don't fall fast. You fall thoughtfully. But when you choose someone? You build with them â€” practically, passionately, and always with one eye on the future.

In work, you're focused, intelligent, and high-performing. You're respected not just for what you do â€” but for how deeply you think about why you do it. You don't chase trends â€” you build legacies.

In friendships and family, you're reliable, intentional, and discerning. You give your energy with care. You protect your peace without guilt. And when your trust is broken, your silence says more than your words ever will.
