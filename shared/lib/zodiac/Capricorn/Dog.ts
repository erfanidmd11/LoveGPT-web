  fullNarrative: `
You are integrity in motion â€” dependable, loyal, emotionally composed, and quietly intense. You don't seek validation â€” you seek *alignment*. And when it comes to love, you're not here to play games. You're here to *build* something unshakeable.

In love, you are slow to trust, but deeply faithful once your heart is committed. You crave a partner who leads with honesty, meets you in effort, and understands that your silence doesn't mean absence â€” it means *depth in translation*. You don't offer surface-level affection. You offer *fortress-level* loyalty.

You love through action. Through structure. Through the kind of presence that speaks louder than any performance. But if your values are violated or your loyalty taken for granted? You don't argue. You *withdraw*. Fully. And permanently.

In your work, you're consistent, focused, and mission-driven. You value responsibility â€” not for its image, but for its impact. You take pride in what you protect and what you produce. You don't cut corners, and you don't tolerate betrayal â€” in business or in love.

In family and friendship, you're the anchor â€” stable, principled, and fiercely dependable. You don't give loyalty lightly, but once given, it's unwavering. You show up when it matters most â€” especially when no one else does.

  fullNarrative: `
You are loyalty with layers â€” steady, intuitive, emotionally wise, and unwavering in your devotion. You don't give your heart away easily, but when you do, it's with full presence and fierce protection. You don't *need* to be needed â€” but when you're chosen, you stand *unshakably* by your choice.

In love, you are grounded and nurturing, yet exacting. You expect clarity, honesty, and commitment â€” not perfection, but *principle*. You want a partner who values depth over performance, and who sees your strength not as a challenge, but as an *invitation* to rise beside you.

You love through loyalty. Through quiet acts of care, thoughtful presence, and unspoken emotional intuition. You don't show affection for show â€” you show it for *keeps*. But if that loyalty is betrayed, disrespected, or manipulated? You don't scream. You *shut the door* â€” cleanly, silently, with zero need for revenge.

In your work, you're responsible, visionary, and deeply respected. You blend compassion with control, and lead from a place of quiet authority. You don't take shortcuts, and you hold yourself (and others) to high moral standards.

With family and friends, you're fiercely protective and nurturing. You love hard, hold firm, and expect emotional honesty in return. You'd rather be alone than tolerated â€” and those in your circle know they are *chosen*, not just accepted.
