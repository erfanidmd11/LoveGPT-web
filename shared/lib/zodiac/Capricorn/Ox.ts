  fullNarrative: `
You are foundation with fire beneath â€” consistent, quietly intense, and rooted in values you don't bend for anyone. You don't chase attention. You earn respect. And you bring calm to the people who get to stand close to your steady presence.

In love, you're reliable, loyal, and patient â€” but make no mistake: you feel deeply. You just don't offer your heart unless you know it's safe. When you love, it's intentional, long-term, and fiercely protective. You show up through consistency, through effort, and through the kind of devotion that doesn't ask for praise â€” it simply *is*.

You want a partner who values growth, not chaos. Someone who respects your pace, understands your drive, and doesn't mistake your silence for distance. You don't need dramatic gestures. You need trust, depth, and mutual ambition â€” in love and in life.

If someone disrespects your loyalty or brings emotional instability? You won't explode. You'll just exit. Quietly. Permanently.

At work, you're disciplined, productive, and deeply strategic. You thrive in environments where responsibility, respect, and results matter. You build legacies â€” not just careers.

In friendships and family, you're the protector and the provider. You may not always say how you feel, but you *show* love through presence, support, and the way you never stop showing up. Unless your loyalty is betrayed â€” in which case, your distance is clean and final.

  fullNarrative: `
You are a quiet storm â€” emotionally composed, deeply loyal, and grounded in values that don't shift with moods or moments. You don't just love â€” you *build love*. And you do it with the kind of devotion that's unshakable once it's earned.

You're steady. You're elegant. And you don't give your heart away easily. But when you do? It's sacred. You protect the people you love with presence, responsibility, and a kind of emotional strength that doesn't ask for attention â€” it simply *shows up*.

In love, you're reserved until trust is earned â€” then fully committed. You express affection through structure: reliability, quiet nurturing, and being the person your partner can depend on no matter the storm. You crave love that's rooted, not rushed. Deep, not dramatic.

You want someone who understands that your stillness is strength â€” not indifference. That your silence is emotional discernment â€” not emotional distance. If your loyalty is dismissed or your effort overlooked, you won't cause a scene. You'll just be gone.

In work, you're dependable, strategic, and high-performing. You thrive in environments where responsibility is respected and excellence is expected. You're not chasing applause â€” you're building *something that lasts*.

In friendship and family, you are consistent, protective, and quietly loving. You're the one people lean on. You carry more than you share. And if your loyalty is ever taken for granted, you walk away with grace â€” but never return without change.
