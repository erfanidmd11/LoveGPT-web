  fullNarrative: `
You are still water that runs *very* deep â€” calm on the surface, quietly intense, and built to move through love and life with purpose, not performance. You don't give trust easily. You observe. You calculate. And when someone earns their way in? You protect them with everything you are.

You lead with discipline and quiet conviction. You're emotionally wise â€” but rarely loud. You're drawn to substance, not surface. Loyalty, not lip service. And if someone plays with your time, your trust, or your truth? You're gone. No fireworks. Just silence. 

In love, you're loyal, strategic, and protective. You express through consistency, effort, and the way you show up *without making a show*. You want someone who sees behind your stillness and understands that your quiet isn't emptiness â€” it's depth.

You don't fall fast. You fall *deep*, once it feels safe. You don't do chaos, and you don't explain your standards. You want connection that feels emotionally intelligent, safe, steady, and rare. And when you find it? You stay. Fully. 

At work, you're efficient, discreet, and powerfully composed. You do best in structured, high-trust environments where your focus and vision are respected. You often lead without needing a title.

In friendship and family, you're loyal, observant, and rarely the loudest â€” but always the one who *knows more than he says*. You offer safety. Wisdom. Presence. And if someone takes that for granted? You disappear with the same grace you arrived with.

  fullNarrative: `
You are elegance with an edge â€” grounded, emotionally layered, fiercely loyal, and commanding without needing the spotlight. Your power isn't loud. It's *lasting*. And when it comes to love, you don't gamble. You calculate. You *build*.

In love, you are discerning, slow to trust, but deeply devoted once loyalty is earned. You don't chase affection â€” you attract depth. And you do so with a gaze that sees *through* people, not just at them. You want a partner who values substance over surface, and has the patience to earn your inner world.

You love through consistency. Through protection. Through creating a life that's stable, meaningful, and yours. But betray your trust? Dismiss your depth? You won't erupt â€” you'll *exit*. Quietly. With precision. Leaving no emotional debris behind.

You're ambitious in life and love â€” not just with career, but with *character*. You crave intimacy with someone who understands that your silence holds more truth than most people's speeches. You won't settle for sparks â€” you want strategy. Legacy. *Real* loyalty.

In work, you're visionary, detail-driven, and quietly authoritative. You don't just deliver â€” you elevate. You hold space for others to rise, but never at the cost of your own stability.

In family and friendship, you're protective, intuitive, and deeply invested in those you trust. But you keep your circle small â€” not from arrogance, but from emotional integrity. You give from overflow, not obligation.
