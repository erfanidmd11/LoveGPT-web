  fullNarrative: `
You are principle in motion â€” structured, loyal, exacting, and quietly intense. You don't do chaos. You do *clarity*. In love, in life, in your legacy â€” everything has a purpose, and everything you give is deliberate.

In love, you are cautious but committed. You offer depth, not display. Respect is your love language, and loyalty is your non-negotiable. You want a partner who understands that your routines are not rigidity â€” they're a sign of respect, of order, of care. You don't love loud. You love *long*.

You love through consistency, protection, and planning. You don't offer empty words â€” you offer structure. You bring safety through action, not performance. But if you're disrespected, emotionally misread, or made to feel disposable? You don't lash out. You *disengage*. Swiftly. With full dignity intact.

In your career, you're methodical, respected, and relentless in your pursuit of excellence. You build with clarity, lead with intention, and rarely tolerate mediocrity â€” in others or in yourself. You're not flashy â€” you're *formidable*.

In family and friendship, you are steady, deeply reliable, and protective. You may not say much, but those you love never wonder where they stand. You hold people accountable â€” not with cruelty, but with care wrapped in expectation.

 ],
  fullNarrative: `
You are grace with grit â€” composed, loyal, discerning, and anchored in unshakable self-respect. You don't chase attention â€” you *command* it. Not through noise, but through presence. Through intention. Through *excellence*.

In love, you are principled and passionate â€” but never reckless. You open slowly, and only to someone who proves they can meet your standards with consistency, not charm. You crave a partner who values order, vision, and emotional intelligence â€” someone who doesn't just admire your strength but *respects* it.

You love through detail, devotion, and precision. You give with care, but never at the cost of your dignity. If you're dismissed, disrespected, or emotionally neglected? You don't fight for clarity. You *become* the clarity â€” by walking away with your peace in one hand and your pride in the other.

In work, you're structured, intuitive, and endlessly driven. You hold yourself to the highest standards â€” not out of insecurity, but because your purpose demands it. You build systems, success, and boundaries â€” all with elegant command.

In friendship and family, you're deeply loyal, protective, and selective. You don't offer access easily, but once someone earns it, you show up like no other. Your loyalty is pure â€” and permanent, unless broken.
