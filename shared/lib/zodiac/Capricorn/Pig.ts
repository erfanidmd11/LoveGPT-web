  fullNarrative: `
You are tenderness with structure â€” emotionally rich, grounded in principle, and quietly romantic. You believe in effort, integrity, and love that is built, not bought. You don't chase intensity for its own sake â€” you seek connection that feels *true* and *safe*.

In love, you're a blend of devotion and discipline. You give your heart fully, but only when you feel emotionally secure. You're deeply affectionate â€” but you also value boundaries and emotional maturity. You want a partner who appreciates your gentleness *and* respects your strength. Someone who won't mistake kindness for weakness â€” or silence for lack of depth.

You love through steady affection, acts of service, and an unwavering emotional presence. You nurture without smothering, and you protect without dominating. But if your generosity is abused or your loyalty betrayed? You'll pull away â€” not to punish, but to *preserve your peace*.

In your work, you're reliable, humble, and hardworking. You lead through example â€” never ego. You may not seek attention, but your results and integrity always draw respect. You care about the people behind the process â€” and it shows.

With friends and family, you're warm, generous, and profoundly loyal. You'll go to great lengths to support the people you love â€” but as you mature, you learn to pour into those who also *pour back*.

  fullNarrative: `
You are softness wrapped in structure â€” emotionally intuitive, loyal, grounded, and quietly powerful. You don't love lightly. You love *fully*. But only when it feels safe, mutual, and aligned with your deepest values.

In love, you are warm, nurturing, and deliberate. You crave emotional honesty, quiet romance, and someone who understands that behind your steady exterior is a heart that *feels everything*. You don't want chaos â€” you want *certainty*. A connection that grows stronger, not louder. Deeper, not just sweeter.

You love through presence, service, and soulful loyalty. You offer care without control, and intimacy without games. But if your devotion is taken for granted, or your emotional labor isn't reciprocated? You don't beg. You *release* â€” gently, but completely.

In work, you are committed, focused, and values-driven. You don't need to lead from the front â€” but your integrity makes people follow you anyway. You blend compassion with competence and make those around you feel *safe*.

With friends and family, you're giving, protective, and deeply intuitive. You feel others' emotions easily â€” and often take them on. But as you evolve, you learn that your care is sacred â€” and must be protected, not depleted.
