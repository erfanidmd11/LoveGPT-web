  fullNarrative: `
You are grit with grace â€” calculated, ambitious, fiercely self-reliant, and unwavering in your pursuit of legacy. You don't move fast â€” you move with *intention*. And once your heart commits, it does so with a depth that's both rare and resolute.

In love, you're slow to open but steady once you do. You want a partner who honors your independence without misreading your emotional reserve as disinterest. You need space to lead, to dream, and to *build* â€” but not alone. When you choose someone, it's not impulsive. It's a decision rooted in loyalty, logic, and long-term vision.

You love through action â€” through provision, consistency, and quiet presence. You may not always say the right words, but you *show up* in the moments that count. And if you feel manipulated, disrespected, or emotionally undermined? You withdraw â€” not to punish, but to protect what's sacred within you.

You're a builder in both love and life. In your career, you're focused, tireless, and always planning two steps ahead. You don't just aim for success â€” you *engineer* it. And while you carry pressure like a second skin, you rarely complain. You just keep going.

With friends and family, you're loyal, discerning, and deeply principled. You won't pretend to be close with everyone â€” but those who earn your trust? You protect them like legacy.

  fullNarrative: `
You are elegance with iron â€” composed, loyal, driven, and emotionally layered. You don't seek approval â€” you set standards. And when it comes to love, you want something worthy of your time, your energy, and your vision.

In love, you're not quick to fall â€” but when you do, you fall with purpose. You crave depth, not drama. Stability, not spectacle. You need a partner who respects your independence, meets your ambition, and understands that your quiet isn't absence â€” it's *wisdom*.

You love through presence, action, and protection. You nurture through planning, through listening, through *doing*. But if you feel emotionally unsafe, dismissed, or taken for granted? You don't explain twice. You *exit* â€” with your peace, your pride, and your boundaries intact.

In your career, you're unstoppable â€” focused, efficient, and built for leadership. You don't just chase goals â€” you *crystallize* them. You're a master of holding composure under pressure, and your success is often quiet, but *undeniable*.

With friends and family, you're selective but devoted. You protect those you love with strategy and strength, not sentimentality. Your inner circle is sacred â€” and small for a reason.
