  fullNarrative: `
You are composed but not cold, structured but not rigid. A man of principles, presence, and emotional depth, you offer people a rare kind of stability â€” the kind that isn't loud, but that lasts.

You're emotionally driven but logical in your delivery. You don't believe in drama â€” you believe in precision. You feel everything, but express selectively. You protect your inner world fiercely and expect others to treat your trust with the same level of respect.

In love, you're loyal, consistent, and a provider of peace. You build relationships with care, timing, and real investment. You want structure *and* softness. Emotional maturity *and* romance. You love through actions, not promises. And while your affection may not be loud, it's layered, dependable, and full of intention.

You need clarity. Games and guesswork wear you out. If someone disrespects your boundaries or dismisses your emotional standards, you don't explode â€” you *exit*. With precision. With grace. With finality.

At work, you are diligent, smart, and committed. You thrive in environments where your methodical mindset and intuitive emotional radar are appreciated. You don't just show up â€” you refine the system, bring order to chaos, and never need to shout to lead.

In family and friendships, you're the emotional stabilizer. You support with strength, hold people accountable with kindness, and expect loyalty to go both ways. But when your presence is undervalued, your retreat is subtle â€” but permanent.

  fullNarrative: `
You are elegance with a backbone â€” graceful, discerning, emotionally deep, and fiercely loyal to what feels right. You don't raise your voice to be heard. You *hold presence*. You speak truth with softness and protect peace like it's sacred territory.

You offer love in steady doses â€” through action, insight, and calm emotional steadiness. You expect the same in return: clarity, consistency, care. You are not for chaos or romantic shortcuts. You want love that is rooted, reciprocal, and real.

In love, you're affectionate, deeply protective, and unshakably loyal â€” but only once your trust is earned. You love someone through rituals, reliability, and how safe they feel when they're around you. But if someone disrespects your emotional labor or dismisses your intuition, you won't fight. You'll simply *disappear* â€” quietly, gracefully, for good.

You don't open quickly. You don't play emotional games. You expect people to take you â€” and your boundaries â€” seriously. And when they do? They find a woman who loves with presence, nurtures with strength, and stays with intention.

At work, you're dependable, emotionally perceptive, and detail-oriented. You lead by example, speak with clarity, and hold yourself to high standards â€” sometimes too high. But your energy brings order to chaos, and your heart brings warmth to the structure you create.

In family and friendships, you're the one people rely on. You carry emotional weight silently, hold everything together, and ask for very little â€” until one day, you realize you should've asked sooner.
