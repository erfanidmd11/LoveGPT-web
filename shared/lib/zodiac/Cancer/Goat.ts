  fullNarrative: `
You are the emotional architect â€” soft-spoken, deeply intuitive, and loyal in a way that doesn't need to be proven with noise. You love with consistency, express through creativity, and carry your heart like it's both a compass and a secret. 

You move slowly through trust but intensely through feeling. You're sensitive, yes â€” but you're not fragile. You feel deeply, reflect often, and love with a steadiness that surprises people who only saw the softness on the surface.

In love, you're nurturing, romantic, and present. You remember the details that matter. You check in even when no one asked. You're the kind of man who shows love in quiet rituals â€” a hand on the back, a coffee made right, a shoulder ready when words fall short.

But you're also deeply affected by emotional imbalance. You give a lot â€” and when it's not returned, your heart closes slowly and quietly. You don't cause a scene â€” you *fade*. Not to punish, but to preserve your spirit.

In career and creativity, you thrive in emotionally safe, aesthetically rich, or meaningful environments. You're a creator at heart â€” whether through words, design, music, or simply building peace in everyday spaces. You lead through presence, not pressure.

In family and friendship, you're the steady one â€” not always loud, but always *there*. You carry emotions that aren't yours. You hold space even when no one sees it. And if you're emotionally taken for granted? You go silent â€” because explaining your needs is something you're still learning how to do.

  fullNarrative: `
You are softness with steel â€” graceful, artistic, and far stronger than most realize. You move with kindness, love with presence, and protect your peace with unspoken power. You feel deeply, give intentionally, and sense things that others miss completely.

You love from the soul, not the script. You create warmth in your relationships without needing grand gestures. You don't demand attention â€” but your presence soothes, inspires, and *stays*. You're the woman who holds everyone else together â€” but quietly craves someone who holds *you* without being asked.

In love, you're romantic, emotionally generous, and deeply loyal. You express affection through nurturing acts, through consistency, through the kind of care that turns relationships into safe havens. But if your love isn't honored? You retreat. First emotionally. Then completely.

You want connection that's calm but deep. Sensual but safe. You aren't interested in chaos. You want someone who understands that your silence is never empty â€” it's sacred. You expect to be *seen* â€” even when you're quiet. And when you feel misunderstood for too long, you disappear with the kind of grace that leaves a lasting echo.

At work, you're creative, emotionally intelligent, and dependable. You shine in meaningful, peaceful environments where you can nurture, lead with empathy, or create beauty. You are often the one people lean on â€” but rarely the one who asks for help. You're learning that *asking* is also strength.

In family and friendship, you are the quiet foundation. You offer loyalty, insight, and love that feels like home. You'll stay soft, present, and committed â€” but only if you feel emotionally safe. Otherwise, your love becomes distant, reserved, and hard to reach again.
