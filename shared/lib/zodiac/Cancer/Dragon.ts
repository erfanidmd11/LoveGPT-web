  fullNarrative: `
You are intensity with a purpose. Emotional yet structured, fiery yet grounded, bold yet nurturing. You lead with your presence, speak from the heart, and love like it's your legacy. You don't do halfway â€” not in relationships, not in work, and definitely not in loyalty.

You feel things on a level most people can't touch. But you don't always *show* it. You protect your emotional depth like sacred ground, revealing it only to those who prove they can handle the fire that comes with it.

In love, you're intense, generous, and powerfully protective. You give your partner a sense of security few can match â€” but that loyalty comes with expectations. You want emotional maturity, consistency, and *depth*. You're a giver â€” but not to the ungrateful. And if your effort is undervalued, you'll shut the door. Calmly. Completely.

You love like a storm with a plan â€” powerful, passionate, and surprisingly strategic. But vulnerability doesn't come naturally. You may show strength first, affection second, and emotional need only after someone has proven they're staying.

In your work and purpose, you're a visionary builder. You're driven to create something lasting â€” something that matters. You don't care for surface-level success â€” you want legacy. You thrive in leadership roles or missions with emotional impact. You inspire others not by trying â€” but by *being real*.

In family and friendship, you're the anchor and the storm. You show up, defend your people, and lead when others collapse. But if your emotional energy is constantly taken and rarely replenished, your distance becomes permanent â€” and your silence speaks volumes.

  fullNarrative: `
You are fire wrapped in intuition â€” the woman who leads with love and doesn't apologize for her presence. You feel everything deeply, but you don't let just anyone *see* it. You are both the caretaker and the queen. The soft place to land and the wall no one gets to lean on without permission.

You're emotionally layered, naturally protective, and wired to create spaces that feel sacred. You don't fall fast â€” but when you do, you fall *all in*. You want a love that builds, protects, evolves â€” not one that flirts with your fire and leaves when it burns too bright.

In love, you're intensely loyal, nurturing, and emotionally magnetic. You give care with intention and expect the same in return. You're not afraid of emotional intensity â€” in fact, you *crave* it. But you also need stability. If someone brings inconsistency or emotional games? You'll walk â€” elegantly, silently, and permanently.

You give love like legacy â€” fierce, full-bodied, and unforgettable. But you're also slow to trust. You test without warning. You guard your softest self behind presence and performance. And only those who stay long enough through your quiet storms ever get to see what you protect.

In work and purpose, you're a natural leader â€” one who blends instinct with impact. You don't lead to be admired. You lead because you *care*. About the people. The mission. The result. You thrive where your values align with your voice â€” and where strength doesn't require emotional suppression.

In family and friendship, you're the one people rely on for more than they know. You're the protector. The soft shoulder. The strategist. But if your emotional care is taken for granted, you don't explain â€” you *exit*. Not in anger, but with a grace that leaves a mark.
