  fullNarrative: `
You are the rock everyone leans on â€” calm, consistent, and steady in both emotion and effort. You don't speak to impress. You don't move for attention. You simply show up â€” with presence, loyalty, and quiet strength that makes people feel *safe*.

You're emotionally deep, but you don't wear it loudly. You feel everything â€” but express selectively. You're the kind of man who remembers birthdays, checks the locks, carries the bags, and never talks about how much you care â€” because you *show* it every day.

In love, you are dependable, protective, and serious about commitment. You take your time. You don't fall fast â€” but when you do, it's for real. You're affectionate through action. Through presence. Through building a life that makes your partner feel secure â€” not just loved, but *safe*.

You may not always say what you feel â€” but your actions never lie. You're here for the long haul. But if someone crosses your loyalty or disrespects your trust? You won't yell. You won't fight. You'll *disengage* â€” and once you're gone, you don't come back.

At work, you are focused, methodical, and mission-driven. You like structure. You thrive in stability. You build your life slowly, and you're okay with that â€” because you don't just want success. You want *foundation*. Something that lasts.

In friendships and family, you're the quiet protector. The one people don't always appreciate until something goes wrong â€” and you're the only one they can count on. You don't need praise. But you *do* need to feel respected. And when you're not? You close the door silently, but completely.

  fullNarrative: `
You are a fortress in floral â€” soft to the touch, immovable at the core. You lead with care, protect with grace, and love with the kind of loyalty that doesn't require grand gestures â€” because your presence is already the gift.

You're emotionally intuitive, yet deeply structured. You don't give your heart recklessly. You build relationships the way you build anything â€” with patience, clarity, and long-term vision. You want connection, not chaos. Peace, not performance. You don't do shallow â€” you do *sacred*.

In love, you're warm, devoted, and grounded. You give through stability, nurturing, consistency. You're the woman who remembers your partner's schedule, favorite food, and childhood trauma â€” and never uses any of it against them. But if your loyalty is misused? You'll retreat â€” calmly, gracefully, and permanently.

You're not afraid of hard conversations â€” but you *hate* emotional games. You need to trust that your heart is safe â€” and when it is, you open fully. But if someone chips away at your peace? You'll protect yourself, not with anger, but with distance.

At work, you are organized, efficient, and full of quiet power. You don't chase attention, but your standards earn respect. You value purpose and reliability. You're the one who gets things done â€” and doesn't need to explain how. You just *do*.

In family and friendship, you're the stable one. The one who remembers birthdays, offers emotional support, and quietly carries more than anyone realizes. But your emotional giving must be mutual â€” otherwise, you quietly begin pulling back.
