  fullNarrative: `
You are emotional depth cloaked in control â€” a man who feels deeply, moves carefully, and loves intentionally. You don't speak for attention. You speak with purpose. You're intuitive, quiet, and protective â€” the type of man people trust without fully understanding *why*.

You don't let just anyone in. You're emotionally discerning, spiritually observant, and slow to offer your heart. But once someone earns it, your love becomes a sacred space â€” private, loyal, and profoundly steady.

In love, you are loyal, sensual, and emotionally intense â€” but you show it through presence, not performance. You protect your emotions with strategy, revealing your vulnerability only to those who've proven their consistency. You may not say "I love you" often, but you live like you mean it.

You crave connection â€” deep, unshakable, mutual â€” but only when it feels emotionally safe. You'll walk away from chaos quickly and quietly. Not out of coldness, but self-preservation. And when you retreat, it's almost always permanent.

In career, you're thoughtful, strategic, and persistent. You do best in spaces that allow you to think, build, and lead with subtlety. You're driven, but not flashy. You care more about integrity and impact than spotlight or speed.

In family and friendship, you are protective, emotionally attuned, and deeply reliable. You might not be the most expressive â€” but your presence, loyalty, and instincts speak louder than any words. You care â€” intensely â€” but you'll never beg for appreciation.

  fullNarrative: `
You are grace with edges â€” elegant, emotionally intelligent, and far more layered than your calm voice suggests. You don't need to raise your volume to be felt. Your energy speaks. Your eyes speak. And when you love? It's precise, powerful, and unforgettable.

You are both the nurturer and the observer. You give deeply â€” but only to those who've proven themselves safe. You sense things others miss. You move slowly, but with intention. You're not afraid of vulnerability â€” you're selective with it. And once someone earns your trust? They'll discover devotion that's quiet, fierce, and fully embodied.

In love, you are tender but strategic. Romantic but realistic. You give with care, protect what's sacred, and require emotional depth in return. You won't waste your time on shallow affection or inconsistency â€” you'll pull away, gracefully, and never explain it twice.

You love through presence, sensuality, and emotional attunement. But you expect your partner to pay attention â€” not just to what you say, but what you *don't*. You'll never beg. You'll never chase. If someone's not ready for depth, you'll let them go with love â€” and move forward with peace.

In career, you're strategic, poised, and emotionally intelligent. You do well in roles that value trust, discretion, and quiet leadership. You don't micromanage â€” you *influence*. People respect you because you lead with composure and heart.

In family and friendships, you are the safe space. You give deeply, protect fiercely, and sense when something's off long before it's spoken. But if your care isn't respected? You'll retreat into silence, and that silence *is* the message.
