  fullNarrative: `
You are a tidal wave in a leather jacket â€” protective, passionate, and unpredictable in all the ways that make you unforgettable. You're a man of feeling and fire. When you love, you love *hard*. When you're hurt, the whole world feels it. And when you decide someone is yours? You protect them with everything you have.

You're emotional, yes â€” but never weak. Your heart is a compass, and your instincts are sharp. You pick up on energy fast, respond from the gut, and react with heat when loyalty or safety is threatened. You're bold in action, yet deeply sensitive underneath. Most people only get one or the other â€” very few are trusted with both.

In love, you're intense, romantic, and fiercely devoted. You give everything â€” attention, time, protection, affection. But if someone plays games with your loyalty or questions your depth? You'll erupt â€” or disappear. There is no middle ground for a heart as strong and sensitive as yours.

You crave emotional connection, but it has to feel *safe*. You need someone who respects your rhythm, understands your fire, and knows that your intensity is rooted in a desire to *build*, not destroy. You are not for the faint-hearted â€” but you are the real deal.

At work, you're dynamic, driven, and assertive â€” but only when you care. If something matters to you, you'll fight for it like your name is on it. You don't do half-effort. But when passion fades, so does your presence.

In friendships and family, you're the loyal protector. You'll go to war for your people â€” but you also need emotional reciprocity. If you feel taken for granted, your inner storm brews silently... and your absence speaks louder than your words ever could.

  fullNarrative: `
You are lightning in silk â€” nurturing by nature, fearless by instinct, and always balancing softness with storm. You're the woman who makes people feel safe and seen, but never gives all of herself away. You protect your people *and* your peace, and anyone who confuses your gentleness for weakness will learn the hard way.

You're emotional â€” but intentional. You don't react without reason. You feel deeply, love wildly, and offer loyalty that can't be bought or broken. But your love must be met with respect. You will fight for those you care about, but if you're ever forced to fight *alone*, your withdrawal will speak louder than your roar.

In love, you're all in. You nurture, support, seduce, and show up with every ounce of your spirit. But you also need space. You crave emotional depth *and* independence. You want a partner who's emotionally intelligent, spiritually steady, and secure enough to let you *lead from love*.

If someone plays games, brings inconsistency, or dismisses your emotional truth â€” you don't argue. You *exit*. Quietly. Powerfully. And without regret.

In work, you're driven, emotionally intelligent, and highly persuasive. You know how to lead with care, build with precision, and inspire people by simply *being yourself*. You thrive when your intuition and creativity are trusted â€” and you're not here to follow anyone else's script.

In friendships and family, you're the protector. You love hard, show up fully, and always seem to know what someone needs before they do. But you have limits. If your loyalty is taken for granted or your care becomes one-sided, your heart will start packing its bags long before your body does.
