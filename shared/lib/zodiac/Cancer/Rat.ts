  fullNarrative: `
You are a strategist with a soul â€” emotionally intelligent, quietly analytical, and more protective than you'll ever admit. You don't waste your words or your heart. You love deeply, think quickly, and rarely move without meaning. You're the guy people trust without knowing why â€” and the one who always seems to know what's going *unsaid*.

You're observant and emotionally layered. You track energy more than words. You lead from behind the curtain, and you don't show your full emotional hand unless someone's already proven they're safe.

In love, you're steady, sensitive, and all in â€” once you trust someone. You want emotional connection that feels *earned*. You offer safety, consistency, and thoughtful care. But you guard your own softness like a fortress. You crave intimacy, but it has to feel *right* â€” not rushed, not performative.

You give with loyalty. You protect with silence. You remember everything â€” especially the small emotional details most people miss. But if someone crosses your boundaries or disrespects your truth? You shut the door quietly, without explanation â€” and rarely reopen it.

In career, you're calculated, focused, and hardworking. You like structure, but you need meaning. You're most alive when your work supports something or *someone* you care about. You don't seek the spotlight â€” but you *do* demand results.

In family and friendships, you're loyal, emotionally generous, and discreet. You listen more than you speak. You support without being asked. But you're not emotionally available to *everyone*. Only those who've proven they'll treat your heart with the care you offer theirs.

  fullNarrative: `
You are the woman who *feels* everything â€” and lets the world see only what you choose. You move with softness and subtlety, but don't mistake that for weakness. You are a quiet storm â€” deeply intuitive, emotionally rich, and fiercely loyal to the few who make it through your filters.

You're not loud. You're layered. You sense shifts in people, in energy, in silence â€” and adjust accordingly. You protect your peace and your people with equal devotion. You don't trust easily, but once someone proves their presence, you love with a kind of depth that changes them.

In love, you're nurturing, romantic, and emotionally generous. You give from the heart, and you notice the smallest details. You build trust slowly and cherish relationships that feel emotionally safe, consistent, and sacred. But once that safety is broken? You don't yell. You quietly shut down, and your distance speaks louder than words ever could.

You don't play games â€” you play for *keeps*. And though you carry your heart carefully, you feel it all, always. Your vulnerability is sacred, your boundaries are real, and your intuition? Unmatched.

In work, you're focused, driven, and subtly strategic. You value stability, meaning, and consistency. You excel in roles that allow emotional intelligence to shine â€” whether that's through people, art, wellness, or thoughtful leadership. You're rarely the loudest voice â€” but often the most trusted.

In family and friendship, you're the safe place. The one who remembers birthdays, shows up with soup and silence, and senses what's wrong before it's said. But your emotional generosity needs to be *matched*. And when it isn't, you pull away â€” not to punish, but to protect.
