  fullNarrative: `
You are a lover, a listener, a giver â€” the kind of man who brings softness into every room and safety into every relationship. You're not here to impress â€” you're here to *show up*. And when you love, you do it with your whole heart â€” no shortcuts, no games, no halfway measures.

You're emotionally tuned-in, incredibly affectionate, and fiercely loyal to the people who prove they value your care. You may be quiet at first, but once you trust someone, your devotion becomes their comfort, their grounding force, their peace.

In love, you're thoughtful, consistent, and deeply romantic. You remember the little things. You build emotional safety through presence, softness, and touch. You don't rush â€” but when you fall, it's deep. You want partnership that feels like *home*, not like performance.

But you're not a fool. You can spot emotional manipulation fast â€” and once you see it, you're out. You may leave quietly, but you don't turn back. You give a lot â€” but you expect to be appreciated. If your love feels taken for granted, your heart closes gently but firmly.

In work, you're dependable, emotionally intelligent, and care deeply about the impact of your effort. You thrive in roles where your emotional instincts and natural generosity are assets â€” healing, creative, or people-centered spaces. You don't chase fame â€” you build legacy through care.

In family and friendships, you're the one people turn to for warmth, laughter, advice, or simply a reminder that they're not alone. You love with ease â€” but when you're overlooked or taken for granted? You shut down emotionally, slowly but completely.

  fullNarrative: `
You are warmth made real â€” the woman who makes people feel safe, seen, and softly held. Your love language is care: small gestures, remembered details, presence that feels like peace. You give without asking. You stay even when it's hard. And you carry the weight of people you love like it's instinct.

But behind that giving nature is strength. You are resilient, perceptive, and more discerning than people assume. You may offer softness, but that doesn't mean you're naive. You know exactly when your love is being appreciated â€” and when it's being used.

In love, you are romantic, loyal, and deeply intuitive. You love to nurture. To pour into someone. To build something beautiful together. But you need safety. Not just physical â€” *emotional*. If a partner takes without giving, you begin to shrink â€” slowly, silently, until the version of you they met is no longer available.

You want consistency. Kindness. Depth. You don't chase intensity â€” you chase *intimacy*. But when you're hurt, you rarely scream. You simply retreat â€” with grace, but with finality.

In work, you're emotionally intelligent, thoughtful, and quietly ambitious. You do best in nurturing, creative, or service-driven roles â€” spaces where your care is *valued*, not taken for granted. You lead gently, support deeply, and protect what you help build.

In family and friendships, you're the one everyone trusts with their truth. You're loyal, attentive, and full of grace. But you need to feel emotionally held in return. And when you don't? You begin to fade â€” not to punish, but to protect your peace.
