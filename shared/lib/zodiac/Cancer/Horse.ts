  fullNarrative: `
You are fire wrapped in feeling â€” a man of fierce loyalty, emotional depth, and untamable energy. You love like you live: fully, wildly, and on your own terms. You don't do surface-level anything. You want meaning, movement, and someone who understands that you can be *both* the shelter *and* the storm.

You're a romantic, but you protect your softness with momentum. You crave intimacy â€” but only when it doesn't feel like a trap. You want a connection that inspires you, grounds you, and lets you run free without running away.

In love, you're generous, attentive, and bold. You give affection easily, devotion carefully, and emotional truth only when you feel safe. You fall hard â€” but you also pull away fast if the energy turns cold, repetitive, or unsafe. You're not afraid of commitment. You're afraid of being *misunderstood* inside it.

You love with adventure â€” through deep talks, shared experiences, spontaneous moments. You want a partner who can match your passion *and* hold your vulnerability. Someone who sees your fire and doesn't try to tame it â€” just holds space for it to burn clean.

In work, you're driven, charismatic, and purpose-fueled. You're best in roles that allow creativity, flexibility, and people. Structure can help â€” but if it turns into confinement, you'll rebel. You work for something bigger than profit â€” *meaning* matters to you.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, funny, and wildly protective. But your emotional battery runs fast. You need people who understand your rhythms â€” who can handle your depth, your highs and lows, and your need to disappear and return with your soul recharged.
