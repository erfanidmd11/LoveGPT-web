  fullNarrative: `
You are laughter with a backbone â€” charming, clever, and far more emotionally in tune than you let on. People see your humor first, your heart second, and only the few who really *get you* ever see both at the same time.

You navigate emotions with agility. You're the guy who can make people feel safe, seen, and laugh until they forget what they were worried about. You deflect with jokes, connect through stories, and protect your emotional truth like a sacred map. You *feel everything* â€” you just rarely admit it out loud.

In love, you're spontaneous, romantic, and subtly loyal. You'll bring your partner joy, light, and passion â€” but you also need emotional stability to stay rooted. You love attention, but you want *presence*. You flirt freely, but love fiercely. Once you choose someone, your devotion runs deep â€” they just have to know how to *read you* beyond the show.

You're sensitive to energy. You notice tone, expression, silence. If something feels off, you *feel* it â€” even if you act like you don't. But instead of confrontation, you often retreat into humor or distraction. When emotionally overwhelmed, you hide behind sparkle. And sometimes, you leave quietly when you were hoping someone would chase you.

In work, you're quick-thinking, adaptable, and creative. You thrive in roles that allow communication, flexibility, and people. You lead best when you feel emotionally connected to your mission â€” and drained quickly when you're just performing a task.

In family and friendship, you're the entertainer and the emotional pulse. You lift others, protect quietly, and bring life wherever you go. But when your emotional giving goes unreciprocated, you shut down fast â€” not to punish, but to protect your light.

You are a spark wrapped in silk â€” a vibrant blend of mischief, warmth, and emotional brilliance. You walk into a room and instantly shift the energy. People gravitate toward your humor, your spirit, your curiosity. But what they don't always see is how much *you're* reading *them* before you even say a word.

You love easily, but not naively. You give freely, but not without awareness. You sense emotional shifts like second nature, and you're constantly balancing the roles of entertainer, empath, and protector â€” often at the same time.

In love, you're playful, expressive, and deeply intuitive. You flirt with ease and connect with warmth â€” but you also test, subtly. You want to be pursued *and* respected. You want to be held *and* allowed to breathe. And while you might deflect with jokes when you're unsure, what you crave is a connection that feels like both laughter and safety.

Your heart is sensitive â€” more than people guess. When you feel unseen or unreciprocated, your light dims. You don't fight â€” you *fade*. You love consistency, but you'll never settle for emotional predictability that lacks depth. You want a partner who can dance with your mind and stay with your soul.

At work, you're creative, communicative, and endlessly versatile. You thrive in roles that let you connect, lead, and *move*. You're not here to sit quietly in a corner. You're here to inspire, disrupt, and make people *feel something* â€” even if it's just joy.

In friendships and family, you're the emotional lifeline â€” the one who lightens the room and holds space without asking. But when your emotional generosity isn't reciprocated? You detach. Not with drama â€” with clarity.
