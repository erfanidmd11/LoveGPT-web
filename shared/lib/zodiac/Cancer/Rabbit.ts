  fullNarrative: `
You are soft strength in a quiet form â€” emotionally tuned, deeply loyal, and quietly powerful in all the ways that make real love feel *safe*. You don't make noise to be seen. You show up in the way you listen, protect, and love without ever asking for applause.

You move through the world with tenderness â€” but not weakness. You see people clearly. You feel energy others miss. And you don't give your heart easily, but when you do? You're all in â€” quietly, fully, forever.

In love, you're nurturing, romantic, and emotionally intuitive. You remember the little things. You create comfort. You build a relationship that feels like *home*. But your heart requires trust. If someone disrespects your emotional space or pushes too hard too fast, you'll disappear â€” gently, silently, and completely.

You don't yell. You *withdraw*. Not to punish â€” but to protect yourself. You want love that's peaceful, real, mutual. You'll give everything for that â€” but you won't chase someone who keeps missing your subtle signals.

In work, you're creative, intentional, and emotionally invested in what you build. You're best in environments where people matter, and where your thoughtfulness can guide strategy. You bring structure to emotional chaos and clarity to interpersonal tension.

In family and friendship, you're the emotional anchor. The safe space. The one who remembers, responds, and shows up with quiet consistency. But when you feel unseen? You fade â€” not to manipulate, but to heal.

  fullNarrative: `
You are softness that shields, sweetness that leads. A woman who doesn't just feel deeply â€” you *translate* feeling. You make people feel safe without trying, seen without speaking, and loved in a way that lingers long after you've left the room.

But don't let the softness fool anyone â€” there's iron beneath your intuition. You don't raise your voice. You raise your *standards*. And once someone crosses a boundary? You don't beg. You *exit*. With elegance. With finality. With peace.

In love, you're loyal, romantic, and full of emotional nuance. You remember everything. You care through action, affection, and the little things others overlook. You build your relationships with intention, sensitivity, and a soul-level presence that few can match.

But you require emotional maturity. You need trust, stability, and depth. If your care is taken for granted â€” or worse, used against you â€” you'll pull away to protect your peace. You don't leave in chaos. You leave in clarity.

At work, you're creative, thoughtful, and often the quiet backbone of any team. You bring emotional intelligence into structure, diplomacy into conflict, and warmth into systems that forgot they needed heart. You may not seek recognition â€” but your presence becomes essential.

In family and close relationships, you are the emotional safe space. The one who shows up with food, a playlist, a hug â€” before anyone even asks. But if your energy is drained without return, your absence becomes the message.
