  fullNarrative: `
You are the quiet strength most people pray for and few actually recognize. You don't speak love loudly â€” you *show* it. In presence. In promises kept. In the way you hold down the emotional fort without ever needing applause for it.

You are deeply principled, protective of those you love, and emotionally anchored in loyalty. You don't give your heart easily, but when you do, it's for keeps. You build trust brick by brick â€” and if someone knocks it down, they don't get a second blueprint.

In love, you are steady, present, and thoughtful. You're not the grand-gesture type. You're the "I remembered this because it matters to you" type. The "you can lean on me no matter what" type. But your depth hides behind calm â€” and you expect others to *feel* your love even when you don't say it.

You want peace and emotional partnership â€” not performance. If someone plays games or disrespects your emotional consistency, you retreat quickly and permanently. You don't do mess. You do meaning.

In work, you are disciplined, focused, and quietly powerful. You do your best when you're given responsibility, structure, and a mission that aligns with your core values. You work best alone or with people who share your standard of integrity.

In family and friendship, you're the protector. The one people trust to be there. You rarely speak first, but your presence is always *felt*. And while you may hold your emotions tight, your care runs deeper than most people realize.

  fullNarrative: `
You are a soft place to land with steel in your spine. A quiet warrior with a nurturing heart. You love deeply, stay loyal longer than most, and protect what matters without ever needing to announce it. You're the one people count on â€” even when they forget to say thank you.

You move with emotional precision. You don't just feel â€” you *track*. You sense energy, unspoken shifts, and what someone isn't saying. You rarely react impulsively, but when something crosses a line? You respond with clarity, not chaos. With distance, not drama.

In love, you are deeply romantic, but realistic. You don't chase fairytales â€” you build safe havens. You give love in the form of presence, protection, and consistency. You want someone who sees your tenderness as strength â€” not as something to manage or melt.

But your loyalty can become your burden. You'll stay long past your emotional expiration date hoping something shifts. And when it doesn't? You quietly let go â€” not to hurt, but to heal.

At work, you're principled, dependable, and highly emotionally intelligent. You shine in roles that value honesty, empathy, and long-term thinking. You're often the one holding the emotional and structural foundation â€” with little recognition, and even less complaint.

In family and friendship, you're the grounding force. You hold space, give advice, and protect people who never knew they needed it. But if your energy is misused, you won't announce your exit â€” you'll simply start protecting *yourself* first.
