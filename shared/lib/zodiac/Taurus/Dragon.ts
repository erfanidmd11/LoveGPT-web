  fullNarrative: `
You are a builder of kingdoms â€” steady, relentless, and unmistakably powerful. People feel your presence before you speak. You're not here for attention â€” you're here to *own the room*. Not with noise. But with certainty. And when you love, lead, or commit â€” you do it like a man with legacy on his mind.

You are both grounded and grand. You dream in structures. You move with purpose. You don't bluff, you *build*. And while your standards are high, your expectations are higher â€” especially for yourself. You don't tolerate laziness, dishonesty, or chaos. You are not easily impressed, and you never fake interest.

In love, you're deep, devoted, and wildly protective. But you don't fall easily â€” and you definitely don't chase. You need respect, emotional intelligence, and someone who understands that your silence isn't distance â€” it's discernment. You express affection through loyalty, stability, and making space in your vision for someone *else*.

You may be misunderstood at first. People mistake your calm for coldness. But you're not cold â€” you're selective. You lead with dignity, love through loyalty, and protect what matters with quiet intensity. When you trust, you *anchor*. When you're betrayed, you *vanish*.

At work and in the world, you're a strategist. A builder. A leader people respect without needing explanation. You don't rush, but you *never stop*. You're driven by vision â€” and you expect the people around you to either elevate or exit.

In family or deep relationships, you're loyal and present, but not always emotionally expressive. You show love through action, consistency, and protection â€” not words or chaos. If you're underappreciated, you won't complain. But you will *withdraw*.

  fullNarrative: `
You are the embodiment of regal fire â€” measured, magnetic, and impossible to overlook. You walk with purpose, speak with calm authority, and build a life that balances beauty with backbone. You don't try to control the room â€” you *set the tone* just by existing in it.

People are drawn to you. Not just because of how you look (though that doesn't hurt), but because of your *presence*. You radiate clarity. Direction. Self-respect. You know what you want, and you won't compromise your standards just to be understood.

In love, you're loyal, sensual, and quietly intense. You don't fall quickly, and you certainly don't chase. You choose â€” with care, with purpose, with long-term vision. When you love, you nurture, protect, and elevate your partner. But if that love feels unstable, manipulative, or disrespectful? You'll disappear without warning â€” and without apology.

You're romantic, but only when it's *earned*. You desire deep connection, but you'll never sacrifice your identity to get it. You offer a rare mix of devotion and discernment. You're not hard to love â€” but you are *impossible to fool*.

At work or in your calling, you're the one people trust to hold the vision *and* the execution. You lead with quiet intensity and handle responsibility like it's second nature. You value results over recognition â€” but you accept both with grace. You don't need validation, but you *do* demand respect.

In family or deep bonds, you're protective and present â€” but you hold boundaries like sacred ground. You give loyalty, structure, and care. But if someone takes you for granted? You won't raise your voice â€” you'll raise your standards and walk.
