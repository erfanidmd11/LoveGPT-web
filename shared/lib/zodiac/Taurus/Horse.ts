  fullNarrative: `
You are the contradiction no one sees coming â€” grounded yet untamable, loyal yet unpredictable. You move through life with charm, confidence, and a quiet storm brewing beneath your smile. People admire your steadiness â€” but few realize you're also one spark away from *leaping into something new*.

You don't follow â€” you *forge*. You live for freedom, but you're also deeply committed to the life you're building. You're bold, determined, and built for the long gameâ€¦ as long as it still inspires you. Because once something feels stale, you're already dreaming of the next adventure.

In love, you're magnetic â€” sensual, playful, and fiercely presentâ€¦ until you're not. You give deeply when your heart's engaged, but when someone tries to own or contain you? You disappear â€” not out of malice, but instinct. You value independence, even in intimacy. And your ideal partner knows how to *run beside you*, not slow you down.

You crave someone who grounds your fire without putting it out. Someone emotionally solid, smart enough to challenge you, and stable enough not to flinch when your restlessness shows up. You offer loyalty â€” but only when it's rooted in *choice*, not pressure.

In career, you're a force. Creative, persuasive, and capable of building systems that actually work. You lead well because you *inspire*. You thrive in work that has movement, autonomy, and space to expand. But repetition drains you. You need vision â€” and the freedom to execute it on your terms.

In family and friendships, you're protective, present, and surprisingly traditional â€” but in your own way. You'll show up for your people. You'll provide. But don't expect you to follow their rules â€” you're writing your own.

  fullNarrative: `
You are a storm dressed in softness â€” confident, creative, and absolutely untamable. You don't follow maps. You build the road. You live from the gut, love with intention, and move through life with a spark that turns heads and shifts rooms. But beneath your energy? Grounding. Purpose. Discipline.

You're fiercely independent â€” not because you don't love deeply, but because you've worked *too hard* to become the woman you are. You choose your path. Your people. Your peace. And anyone who tries to own you? Won't last long in your world.

In love, you're sensual, romantic, and emotionally present â€” until someone mistakes your fire for chaos. You crave connection *and* freedom. Loyalty *and* space. You need a partner who's solid enough to ground you and brave enough to let you *run*. If they can't? You'll outgrow them with grace and keep going.

You love through touch, presence, attention, and fierce emotional intelligence. But you also need to roam â€” mentally, spiritually, physically. You're not built for stagnation. You're built for *expansion*. That includes in love. That includes in life.

At work, you're a visionary with serious follow-through. You bring flair, grounded confidence, and the ability to turn chaos into structure. You can lead, but only if you're free to do it *your* way. You're best when you believe in what you're building â€” otherwise, you're already halfway out the door.

In family or close bonds, you're fiercely protective. You show up â€” but on your own terms. You give deeply, but only to those who don't demand it. If someone disrespects your boundaries, they'll find out just how fast your warmth can cool.
