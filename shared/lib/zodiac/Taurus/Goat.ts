  fullNarrative: `
You are the emotional architect â€” a man who builds love like a home: brick by brick, soft but solid, slow but real. You don't love loudly, but you love deeply. You don't show off your brilliance, but it's in everything you create. You're tender in your presence, strong in your stillness, and devoted in a way few truly understand.

You have an inner world rich with feeling, thought, and beauty. You express through what you do â€” not just what you say. You listen. You observe. You feel â€” more than most. But you share that depth only when someone proves they can handle it.

In love, you're loyal, sensual, and emotionally present. You build trust carefully. You're not here for chaos or guesswork â€” you're here for *real*. For comfort. For touch that means something and words that aren't thrown away. You're nurturing without needing to be flashy. But don't mistake that for weakness. You have *boundaries*. And when they're crossed? You don't yell. You disappear â€” slowly, but permanently.

You may resist confrontation, but you're not passive. You know what you want. You simply prefer peace over power struggles â€” until someone challenges your integrity. Then the soft-spoken man becomes the immovable one.

In career, you're steady, capable, and low-key brilliant. You're drawn to creative or emotionally rich work â€” anything that brings meaning to what you do. You may work quietly, but your results speak for themselves. You value beauty, harmony, and time to do things right.

In family and close relationships, you're the nurturer. The quiet protector. You show up through rituals, through routine, through the kind of emotional safety most people only dream about. But when you're taken for granted, you retreat â€” not out of pride, but out of self-preservation.

  fullNarrative: `
You are the embodiment of gentle power â€” poetic in expression, grounded in values, and quietly resilient. You don't yell to be heard. You don't rush to be chosen. You simply *are* â€” deeply, lovingly, and without apology. And in your presence, others soften.

You offer peace â€” but you're not passive. You crave beauty, connection, and emotional safety. You build relationships slowly, nurture them intentionally, and walk away when they no longer respect your softness. You are warm, sensual, affectionate â€” but you know how to protect your energy like a quiet queen.

In love, you are nurturing, loyal, and emotionally layered. You give with your full heart â€” but only to those who prove they can honor it. You don't love halfway. You love in dinners cooked, backs rubbed, eyes held a little too long. And when you're hurt? You'll retreat with grace â€” but that silence speaks louder than any fight ever could.

You're often misunderstood as delicate â€” but those who know you best understand you're made of stone wrapped in silk. You can endure more than most, but you shouldn't have to. You deserve a love that holds you *while* you hold the world.

In work and purpose, you value beauty, meaning, and structure. You're not here to compete â€” you're here to *contribute*. You thrive in creative, nurturing, or service-centered environments where you can move at your own pace and build something that feels true to you.

In family and friendships, you're the quiet glue. You remember birthdays, show up without being asked, and notice emotional shifts before people even name them. But you also carry too much without complaint â€” and then wonder why you feel invisible. You give deeply. Just make sure you're not giving yourself away.
