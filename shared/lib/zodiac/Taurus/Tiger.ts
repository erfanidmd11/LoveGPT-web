  fullNarrative: `
You are the storm inside the fortress â€” unshakably grounded, but never to be underestimated. On the outside, you seem composed, traditional, even predictable. But underneath? There's a fire that's restless, wild, and strategic. You're not here to follow anyone's blueprint â€” you're building your *own*.

You're the kind of man who plays the long game. You don't talk about what you're building â€” you just build it. Brick by brick. Quietly. Intentionally. And when people finally notice? You're already on to your next level.

In love, you're passionate, loyal, and deeply protective. You're not overly expressive with words, but you love with presence, purpose, and stability. You show up. You hold it down. You create space for your partner to thrive â€” but you also expect *respect*. If that's lacking, you retreat â€” slowly, permanently.

You're naturally dominant, but not controlling. You want to lead â€” not because you need power, but because you *carry vision*. You expect your partner to be strong, self-aware, and aligned â€” not needy or chaotic. You're sensual, romantic, but guarded until trust is earned.

In work and life, you're a powerhouse. You lead with quiet authority, build systems that last, and outwork most without burning out. You're practical but not passive, fierce but not reckless. You prefer structure â€” but you're not afraid to break it if it doesn't serve your goals.

In family and friendship, you're the protector. You don't say much, but your presence is a promise: *you're safe here*. You'll never broadcast your emotions â€” but you'll build a life that shows them.

  fullNarrative: `
You are a force wrapped in elegance â€” soft enough to soothe, strong enough to command. You lead with presence, protect with fire, and love with a devotion that's both grounding and rare. People admire your beauty, but it's your *energy* that leaves them breathless.

You are steady, but not passive. You are nurturing, but never naive. You don't chase chaos â€” but you won't bow to silence either. You know who you are, and you're not afraid to walk away from anything that doesn't match the life you're building.

In love, you want the real thing. You're affectionate, sensual, and romantic â€” but you're not here for games or emotional shortcuts. You need someone who respects your strength, cherishes your softness, and never confuses your silence for submission. You crave passion *and* stability. And yes, you want both â€” unapologetically.

You give deeply â€” with intention, with rhythm, with heart. But once you feel disrespected, overlooked, or emotionally manipulated? You'll vanish like you were never there. No drama. Just distance.

In career and purpose, you're a builder and a visionary. You work with intention, strategy, and style. You're not afraid of pressure â€” in fact, you often *thrive* under it. You're loyal to your mission and fierce about your standards. You don't just show up â€” you elevate the room.

In family and friendships, you're the protector. You care for others in a way that's both quiet and fierce. You love with effort, with time, and with presence. But you need to be valued in return. Otherwise? You'll stop showing up â€” not out of spite, but out of self-respect.
