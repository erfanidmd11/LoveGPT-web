  fullNarrative: `
You are still water with serious depth â€” quiet, composed, and far more intense than you let on. You don't speak to be heard. You speak when it matters. You don't chase â€” you *choose*. And when you commit, it's with loyalty that feels like gravity: grounded, serious, unshakable.

You lead from behind the scenes. You read the room, sense the energy, and act with precision. Emotionally, you're private. But that doesn't mean you don't feel â€” you feel *everything*, you just don't hand it out easily. Your restraint is not coldness â€” it's discipline.

In love, you're deeply sensual, intuitive, and focused. You may not flood someone with words, but your presence speaks volumes. You express love through touch, loyalty, and emotional protection. You're selective about who you let close â€” but once someone's in, you guard that bond like it's sacred.

You require trust, safety, and honesty. If someone brings chaos, neediness, or dishonesty to the table â€” you'll disappear. Slowly. Quietly. But completely. You value consistency, maturity, and someone who doesn't need to be "saved," just *seen*.

In work and purpose, you're patient, analytical, and quietly driven. You don't care for attention â€” but you care deeply about results. You thrive when given independence and room to design systems or solve problems. You're a thinker, a planner, and a quiet achiever with a strong moral compass.

In family and friendships, you're loyal and protective â€” but private. You listen more than you speak. You love through reliability. But you need people who can respect your quietness and understand that just because you're silent doesn't mean you're absent.

  fullNarrative: `
You are elegance with a lock on it â€” composed, wise, and not for everyone. You move through life with a quiet knowing, a soft grace, and an unshakable internal compass. You don't need the spotlight â€” you *are* the standard. And those who are paying attention know better than to underestimate you.

You offer affection with intention. Every word, every gesture is chosen. You're calm under pressure and deeply tuned into your environment. You observe. You listen. And you only open up when someone makes you feel emotionally *safe* â€” not impressed, *safe*.

In love, you're sensual, deliberate, and fiercely loyal. You love slowly, but once you do, your devotion is profound. You don't flood people with emotion â€” you *wrap* them in it, silently and steadily. You desire depth, emotional maturity, and someone who doesn't confuse your quiet with weakness.

Your love is earned. And if someone thinks they can win you with charm and chaos, they'll lose before they even get close. You're too discerning, too self-aware, and too grounded to fall for anything that doesn't feel *right*.

In work, you're brilliant and understated. You prefer roles where you can lead without shouting, guide without drama, and execute without oversight. You work smart, not loud. And your value becomes obvious the moment systems start falling apart â€” and you're still standing, solving, recalibrating.

In family and friendship, you are the calm anchor. You're emotionally generous, but you give in layers â€” based on earned trust. You hold space without performance. You forgive slowly. And when you're done, you're *done*. Not with a storm â€” with silence.
