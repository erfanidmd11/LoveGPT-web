  fullNarrative: `
You are the calm in the storm â€” steady, sensual, and quietly magnetic. You don't demand attention, but you receive it anyway. Your presence is soft, grounded, and elegant â€” like the man who could rebuild a broken world with nothing but time, music, and a cup of tea.

You're deeply romantic but not reckless. You build love slowly, protect your energy fiercely, and give only what feels *true*. You're thoughtful, emotionally aware, and more sensitive than you let on. You don't just love with heart â€” you love with *attention*. To detail. To presence. To the way someone's soul moves, not just how they speak.

In love, you're consistent. Protective. Deeply affectionate â€” but only once trust is earned. You're turned off by chaos, impulsiveness, or anything that feels manipulative. You need emotional safety before you'll reveal your inner world. But when you do? You love with soul.

You're not the loudest man in the room â€” you're the one who people remember after they leave. Because you actually *listen*. You notice. You make others feel seen, without needing anything back. And while you may seem passive â€” you're not. You just don't waste energy on anything that doesn't feel real.

Professionally, you're dependable, creative, and intuitive. You think long-term, build slowly, and care deeply about the impact of your work. You may gravitate toward art, wellness, education, or design â€” anything that combines beauty with function. You're rarely in a rush â€” but you always arrive with quality.

In family or friendship, you're nurturing, observant, and sometimes too forgiving. You'll carry burdens quietly, but when pushed too far, you'll disappear without drama. Not because you want revenge â€” but because you value your peace more than your pride.

  fullNarrative: `
You are softness with structure â€” a woman who leads with grace but never loses her ground. You move like poetry but think like a strategist. You are feminine, loving, affectionate â€” but beneath that delicate exterior is a fortress of patience, intuition, and emotional strength.

You love beautifully and carefully. You're romantic â€” but practical. You don't fall for fast words or loud gestures. You fall for *safety*. For consistency. For someone who understands that devotion isn't built overnight â€” it's earned through presence and care.

In love, you're loyal, sensual, and nurturing. You give slowly, but fully. You're attuned to the emotional temperature of the room, reading between every line â€” often giving what others need before they know how to ask. But when you feel emotionally dismissed or neglected? You quietly shut down. And when you leave, it's softâ€¦ but final.

You don't do chaos. You don't do games. You value peace, beauty, and people who speak clearly. And while you might seem gentle on the outside, you have boundaries forged from experience. You're not easily shaken â€” and you rarely let the same person hurt you twice.

At work, you're steady, creative, and organized. You don't chase fame â€” you create harmony. You thrive in environments where beauty, care, and consistency matter. You lead with collaboration, not control â€” and when you're valued, you bloom.

In family and friendship, you're the glue. You show up early, stay late, remember birthdays, and notice when someone's quiet. You love deeply, but you need to feel safe doing so. If people take your emotional labor for granted, you start pulling back â€” first emotionally, then physically.
