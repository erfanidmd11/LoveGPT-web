You are the slow-burn genius â€” practical, playful, and always five moves ahead. You blend grounded loyalty with mischievous curiosity. People meet your humor first, your calm second, and your intelligence third â€” but when it all clicks? They see that you're not just clever. You're *crafted*.

You make life feel lighter, but your intentions run deep. You charm without pretending. You lead without demanding. And when you love? You love with a quiet intensity masked in sarcasm, patience, and the kind of presence that feels like home.

In love, you're flirtatious, tactile, and surprisingly dependable â€” once you've chosen your person. You enjoy playfulness, mental stimulation, and slow, sensual connection. But you're also particular. You don't like chaos, you avoid clinginess, and you're instantly turned off by drama dressed up as passion.

Your emotions run deeper than you show. You're not one to spill everything â€” you reveal in layers. But when you're in, you're *in*. You protect with humor. You love through consistency. You show up, not because you have to â€” but because you *chose* to.

Professionally, you're a strategist with creative edge. You know how to execute a plan *and* make people laugh while doing it. You're a team player â€” but only when the team respects your independence and wit. You're more leader than follower â€” but never loud about it.

In family or deep friendships, you're supportive, funny, and grounded. You're the "fix it, lighten it, solve it" kind of man. But if you're unappreciated too long? You'll fade out of reach, not with anger â€” with quiet finality.

  fullNarrative: `
You are charm laced with structure â€” flirtatious yet grounded, graceful but never to be underestimated. You don't perform. You *curate*. You know how to captivate without losing control, entertain without needing approval, and love without abandoning yourself.

You're playful, sensual, and deeply intuitive. You understand people quickly â€” what they want, what they're hiding, what they're hoping for. You rarely say everything you're thinking, but you're always five emotional steps ahead. You might be smiling â€” but you're watching.

In love, you're magnetic. You flirt effortlessly, but commit intentionally. You don't fall easily â€” and you don't stay unless it feels *real*. You want honesty wrapped in charm. A partner who's emotionally present, intellectually sharp, and smart enough not to mistake your laughter for lightness.

You offer loyalty, comfort, and fierce feminine strength. But once your trust is broken, your silence is swift â€” and surgical. You don't fight to stay. You simply *leave better*.

At work, you're strategic, clever, and effective. You can outthink most people in the room â€” and do it with style. You thrive where ideas meet execution, and where emotional intelligence isn't just a buzzword. You know when to lead, when to listen, and when to quietly pivot into your next move.

In family and friendship, you're the favorite â€” warm, attentive, hilarious. But few know how much you carry beneath the surface. You love hard, but expect a return on emotional investment. If someone keeps withdrawing without depositing? You won't announce your exit. You'll just *be gone*.
