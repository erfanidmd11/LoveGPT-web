  fullNarrative: `
You are the foundation others lean on â€” calm, consistent, and built for the long haul. You don't rush, you don't bluff, and you definitely don't quit. When you commit â€” whether to a dream, a partner, or a promise â€” you *follow through*. Every. Single. Time.

You aren't flashy, but you are magnetic in your own way. Quiet presence. Clear values. Deep loyalty. You don't need to be the center of attention â€” because you *are* the center of stability. Your energy calms the room, but your conviction commands it.

In love, you're practical and passionate. You might not always say what you feel â€” but you'll show it. Through effort. Through presence. Through the life you build around someone, not just beside them. You're a romantic â€” but on your own terms. You don't do chaos, and you *don't tolerate games*.

Once someone earns your trust, you become a quiet protector â€” strong, reliable, and deeply devoted. But if someone betrays that trust? You won't yell. You won't fight. You'll just leave. Emotionally. And they might never see that version of you again.

In career and purpose, you're the long-game builder. You show up, stay late, and outlast the trends. You rise slowly â€” but when you arrive, you stay. You value financial stability, long-term impact, and work that aligns with your integrity. You're often the one people lean on during storms â€” because you don't shake easily.

In family, you're solid. Protective. The quiet provider who doesn't always express love in words, but always makes sure the lights are on and the doors are locked. You carry responsibility well â€” but sometimes, you forget you don't have to carry it *alone*.

  fullNarrative: `
You are strength in satin â€” calm, composed, and quietly unshakeable. You don't rush, react, or unravel. You *anchor*. In love, in work, in family â€” you're the one who keeps it together, holds it down, and builds something real while others are still dreaming.

You don't broadcast your power â€” but it's felt. You're emotionally intelligent, deeply loyal, and wired for purpose. You protect what you love with patience and precision. You don't chase â€” you *choose*. You don't compete â€” you *commit*.

In love, you're nurturing, sensual, and serious about what you give. You love through action: feeding, organizing, showing up. You're slow to open â€” but once you're in, you're *in*. You want stability, honesty, and a partner who respects the emotional labor you do in silence.

But don't mistake your devotion for weakness. You have hard limits. You will give â€” again and again â€” until you don't. And when you're done? It's quiet. But final.

At work, you're consistent, practical, and the one people rely on when everything else is crumbling. You execute with care. You don't seek the spotlight â€” but you're often holding the system together behind it. You work for stability, not ego. For impact, not approval.

In family, you're the rock. You carry emotional weight, manage responsibilities, and protect your circle like it's sacred. And it is. But you rarely ask for the same in return â€” which is where your resentment quietly begins to grow.
