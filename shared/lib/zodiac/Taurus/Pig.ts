  fullNarrative: `
You are warmth wrapped in willpower â€” grounded, generous, and deeply human. You don't make promises you can't keep. You don't speak unless it means something. And you love with presence, not performance.

You're not in a rush â€” not with love, not with life, and definitely not with your emotions. You believe in *earning* someone's trust and building something solid. You're thoughtful, protective, and remarkably self-aware for someone who rarely needs to be the loudest in the room.

In love, you're loyal, affectionate, and full of subtle romance. You show up in small ways that add up to *everything* â€” a warm meal, an unspoken favor, a quiet understanding that says, "I see you." You're sensual by nature, and your love language is often acts of service or physical affection. But you're sensitive too â€” and when taken for granted, your silence says more than words ever could.

You don't ask for much â€” but you give plenty. And if someone mistakes your patience for passivity? They'll never see you walk away â€” only realize they've already been left behind.

In work, you're consistent, practical, and values-driven. You'd rather do something well than fast. You want stability â€” not just financially, but emotionally. You don't chase ambition for ego â€” you work so the people you care about feel safe, seen, and supported.

In family and friendships, you're the one who shows up when no one else does. You don't always talk about your emotions, but you feel them deeply. You're a nurturer in disguise â€” the rock, the heart, the unspoken leader who takes care of everything while pretending not to need anything.

  fullNarrative: `
You are the quiet giver â€” a woman who creates safety, beauty, and love without ever needing to announce it. You're calm under pressure, soft in your presence, and stronger than most people realize. Your warmth is your power. And your patience? It's a choice â€” not a weakness.

You love fully, but you love *selectively*. You don't chase attention. You don't perform for approval. You show up, you stay, and you give â€” until you realize the energy isn't being matched. Then, you shift. Gently. And if you need to, permanently.

In love, you are sensual, loyal, and emotionally grounded. You express affection through care â€” cooking, listening, remembering, showing up. You don't want surface charm. You want *substance*. You're turned on by consistency, emotional maturity, and presence. You're patient â€” but not passive. And if someone confuses the two, they'll find your silence sharper than any argument.

You offer emotional depth wrapped in kindness. But once you feel taken for granted, your heart begins to close â€” softly, slowly, but with finality. You're not here to beg for reciprocity. You're here to build *something real*.

In your work and calling, you're dependable, nurturing, and purposeful. You prefer meaningful tasks, environments where loyalty is appreciated, and roles where your emotional intelligence is a gift â€” not a liability. You bring grace to every task. But don't mistake grace for complacency. You know your worth â€” even when others don't.

In family and friendship, you are the safe space. The one who remembers. The one who shows up. You hold everyone together â€” often without anyone realizing you're the reason it *feels like home*.
