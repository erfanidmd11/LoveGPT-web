You are silence with a pulse â€” composed, observant, and always calculating more than you reveal. You don't need to speak loudly to be felt. You walk into a room and instantly start reading the energy. You're strategic, thoughtful, emotionally intelligent â€” and you never make careless moves, especially with your heart.

In love, you're slow to trust, but fiercely loyal once you do. You love in quiet ways â€” through consistency, protection, small details remembered, and the kind of emotional presence that doesn't overwhelm but *grounds*. You're not chaotic. You're calm. And when someone earns your love, they get a man who never stops showing up â€” even if he doesn't always say it out loud.

You are sensual, selective, and guarded â€” not out of ego, but *protection*. You want emotional safety, loyalty, and someone who can respect your need for space, silence, and subtlety. If your energy is disrespected or taken for granted, your goodbye is permanent â€” and it doesn't need to be announced.

At work, you thrive in structured, focused environments that require intellect and precision. You don't need the spotlight. You *are* the quiet force behind the most important wins. You work with care, lead with logic, and move only when it serves your long-term vision.

In friendship and family, you are loyal, private, and deeply supportive. You don't offer affection easily â€” but when you do, it's authentic. You'll hold space, give advice, and stand silently beside those you trust. But if someone proves disloyal, they won't get a second opportunity.

  fullNarrative: `
You are elegance with depth â€” graceful, intuitive, and always aware of more than you let on. You read between the lines. You sense shifts in energy before they happen. You don't chase â€” you *curate*. Every word, every gesture, every silence is deliberate.

You don't love loudly. You love *intentionally*. With care, with consistency, and only once someone proves they are safe enough to receive the truth behind your calm exterior. You are fiercely loyal, but selectively so. Because your heart is not up for negotiation â€” it's *earned*.

In love, you're sensual, emotionally intelligent, and deeply committed â€” once trust is established. You give through subtle presence, quiet support, and the kind of loyalty that never needs to be announced. But if someone crosses a boundary? You'll disappear with elegance. No drama. No second warning.

You want a partner who's emotionally awake, intellectually present, and doesn't mistake your stillness for softness. You need someone who can handle your complexity â€” not try to simplify you to feel comfortable.

At work, you're polished, analytical, and quietly influential. You thrive in roles that require insight, trust, and high-level thinking. You lead best from behind the curtain, where clarity and precision are the real power plays.

In friendships and family, you are loyal, emotionally attuned, and softly protective. You hold secrets, create emotional safety, and show up without the need for recognition. But if you feel undervalued or misread too often? You don't correct them â€” you just *leave*.
