  fullNarrative: `
You are strategy with a soul â€” charismatic, intentional, and emotionally deep in ways you rarely reveal upfront. You don't waste energy on anything that doesn't serve purpose or truth. You're a quiet storm â€” one built to lead, protect, and *build* something meaningful.

You take love seriously. Life seriously. Loyalty *very* seriously. You don't open easily â€” but when you do, your heart is fierce and unwavering. You lead with integrity, and expect that same level of devotion in return. If it's not mutual? You're out. Not with drama â€” with finality.

In love, you're a slow burn: reserved at first, then deeply passionate once your trust is earned. You give through consistency, protection, and presence. You want connection that respects your mind *and* your fire â€” a partner who knows how to hold space for your intensity without trying to tame it.

You struggle to express your softer emotions, but your loyalty speaks for itself. You don't say "I love you" a hundred times a day â€” you *live* like you mean it. And if someone betrays that? They don't get another round.

At work, you're visionary, grounded, and quietly ambitious. You bring clarity where there's chaos, and direction where others are still figuring it out. You don't need a spotlight â€” your results do the talking.

In family and friendship, you're dependable, protective, and intentional. You're the one people lean on â€” but few know how to truly support you back. If your energy isn't respected? You'll retreat into focus and never explain your absence.

  fullNarrative: `
You are fire in perfect form â€” poised, intentional, and unshakably loyal. You don't need to dominate the room to lead it â€” you just *exist*, and the tone changes. You're intuitive, protective, and deeply connected to your truth. You love from strength. You speak with clarity. And you walk with a quiet kind of power that doesn't ask permission.

You hold high standards â€” for yourself, and for everyone in your life. Not out of ego, but *honor*. You don't play with emotions, and you don't tolerate inconsistency. When you love, you love fully â€” but only when it's *real*. Your heart is a sacred place, and only the worthy get in.

In love, you're loyal, nurturing, and quietly intense. You give devotion through presence, accountability, and fierce protection. You want a partner who respects your independence, matches your loyalty, and can handle the depths you carry behind your eyes. If someone plays with your trust or your time? You leave â€” gracefully, but permanently.

You're not chaotic â€” you're *calculated*. You love deeply, but you stay grounded in your values. You want peace, not performance. Passion, not games. You need a love that meets you at your level â€” and doesn't flinch when your fire gets close.

In work, you're focused, high-achieving, and built for leadership. You bring vision, organization, and emotional insight â€” a rare and powerful combination. You don't need constant validation. You need *results* â€” and alignment with your values.

In friendship and family, you are the protector, the planner, the emotional compass. People trust you â€” because you say what you mean, and you follow through. But if your loyalty is taken for granted, your distance is swift â€” and non-negotiable.
