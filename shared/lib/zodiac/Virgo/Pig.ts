  fullNarrative: `
You are the quiet kind of love that stays â€” loyal, soft-spoken, emotionally wise, and deeply invested in the people and spaces you hold dear. You give your heart in ways that are humble but unmissable â€” a kind word, a small gesture, a daily act of care that says, "I'm here, and I mean it."

You're not loud about your feelings, but they're always real. Always present. You show up with consistency, and you protect your people through your calm presence, thoughtful words, and steady loyalty.

In love, you're nurturing, attentive, and surprisingly romantic. You remember what matters. You give through effort, not empty words. You love with your time, your attention, your patience â€” and expect the same sincerity in return. You don't need dramatic gestures â€” you need *realness*. Emotional honesty. Stability. Heart.

But you can be too quiet about your needs. You'll give until you're drained, hoping someone notices â€” and if they don't, your heart starts pulling away before your words ever do. You're deeply sensitive, though few ever see the full depth you carry.

In work, you are dependable, values-driven, and service-oriented. You thrive in environments that reward compassion, detail, and commitment. You're not chasing the spotlight â€” you're chasing *impact*. Something meaningful. Something that matters.

In friendships and family, you're the anchor â€” warm, protective, and always there. You'll show up again and again, without needing credit. But if your effort is overlooked or your emotional care taken for granted? Your boundaries go up quietly â€” and your absence becomes the loudest thing in the room.

  fullNarrative: `
You are grace in devotion â€” soft-hearted, emotionally discerning, and devoted to loving in a way that feels *safe*, sacred, and strong. You offer affection through attention, thoughtfulness, and presence. You don't chase. You *tend*. You cultivate. And when someone earns your heart, they receive a loyalty that never needs to be questioned.

You love slowly, but completely. You are loyal â€” not blindly, but because you've *chosen* to be. You give with care, and you expect that same emotional maturity in return. You're not here for performance. You're here for *partnership* â€” grounded, nurturing, lasting.

In love, you're romantic and intentional. You don't need chaos to feel passion. You need consistency to feel safe â€” and from that safety, your love flows endlessly. You notice the small things. You remember the unspoken. You build your love story one meaningful moment at a time.

But when your emotional effort isn't mirrored? You withdraw. Not to punish â€” to protect. You're the kind of woman who holds space for everyone, yet forgets to ask for space in return. And when your silence arrives, it's rarely temporary.

In work, you are dependable, emotionally intelligent, and deeply service-minded. You thrive in roles where compassion, integrity, and excellence matter. You're not loud, but your presence *shapes* the space around you.

In friendship and family, you are the nurturer. The emotional heartbeat. The one who checks in, shows up, and carries what others don't even know they dropped. But if that emotional labor isn't respected? You'll quietly exit â€” no confrontation, just closure.
