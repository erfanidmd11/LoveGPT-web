  fullNarrative: `
You are precision with a pulse â€” composed, intentional, emotionally steady, and unshakably loyal when someone earns their way into your world. You don't speak often, but when you do, it matters. You're not here for show â€” you're here for *substance*. And your love reflects that.

You believe in building things â€” not just dreaming about them. You want a relationship with clarity, consistency, and depth. You're protective of your peace, loyal to your people, and grounded in truth over trend. You don't fall fast â€” but once you do, your love is clean, steady, and full of quiet devotion.

In love, you're loyal, structured, and deeply present. You express affection through reliability, acts of service, and subtle rituals. You want emotional maturity, mutual respect, and space to show up as you are â€” no theatrics required.

You can be emotionally reserved at times â€” not because you don't feel, but because you feel *so much* you only show it where it's safe. You guard your heart behind structure and logic, and you're not easily shaken â€” but when you are? You go silent. And that silence is your boundary.

In work, you're principled, meticulous, and highly effective. You lead with competence, not ego. You shine in roles that allow you to manage, refine, and elevate systems or people. You build trust through discipline â€” and people rely on your consistency even more than they know.

In friendships and family, you are protective, present, and deeply loyal. You won't always say what you're feeling â€” but you'll be the first to show up when someone needs you. But if that loyalty isn't mutual? You walk. Quietly. With integrity.

  fullNarrative: `
You are precision in pearls â€” composed, discerning, and emotionally present in a way that feels grounding and safe. You love with care, speak with intention, and hold your standards like a crown â€” not for ego, but because your peace is *sacred*.

You don't fall fast â€” you fall when it makes sense. When it feels real. You're not interested in romantic chaos or sweet-talking charm. You want honesty, loyalty, and love that holds up under pressure. You give fully â€” but only when someone earns it.

In love, you're elegant, attentive, and unwaveringly loyal. You give affection through quiet acts of devotion, structure, and emotional presence. You love deeply â€” but selectively. If someone tries to test your patience or underestimate your loyalty, they'll feel your absence before they realize what they lost.

You crave a relationship that's emotionally mature, peaceful, and purposeful. You won't stay in dynamics that don't nourish your mind *and* your spirit. You know your value â€” and you require your partner to rise to it, not resent it.

In work, you're efficient, ethical, and clear. You thrive in roles where integrity, consistency, and high standards are assets â€” not obstacles. You often carry more than people realize, yet still make it look effortless.

In friendships and family, you are thoughtful, protective, and a natural emotional stabilizer. You're the one who organizes the chaos and calms the emotional storm â€” without needing recognition. But if your energy is consistently overlooked or drained, your boundary is clear, immediate, and permanent.
