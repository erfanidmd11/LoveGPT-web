  fullNarrative: `
You are the calm in the emotional storm â€” thoughtful, grounded, and quietly intense in all the ways that matter most. You feel everything â€” and often more deeply than you admit. But you carry it all with grace, humility, and a calm exterior that keeps everyone else steady.

You love slowly, but intentionally. You observe before offering trust. You're not here to be loud â€” you're here to be *real*. And when someone earns your love, they receive a deeply grounded, emotionally rich man who builds safety through quiet action and consistent care.

In love, you're romantic, supportive, and emotionally intelligent. You express affection through presence, through detail, through building something stable and meaningful. You don't perform romance â€” you live it. But if your care goes unnoticed or unreciprocated? You withdraw, not to punish â€” but to protect yourself.

You want connection that's deep and soft, thoughtful and secure. You value peace over drama, honesty over flash, and emotional maturity above all. You'll give your heart fully â€” but only when it feels safe enough to be seen and held.

At work, you're creative, dependable, and internally driven. You prefer structure but need a sense of meaning behind what you do. You're often the quiet architect behind success â€” the one who doesn't speak often but, when he does, people listen.

In friendship and family, you're present, loyal, and emotionally available â€” in your own steady way. You may not always speak up first, but you're always there when it matters. And when your care is taken for granted? You quietly disappear from emotional reach â€” without needing to announce your exit.

  fullNarrative: `
You are softness with structure â€” kind, emotionally attuned, and more resilient than you ever let the world know. You don't lead with volume â€” you lead with grace. You love quietly but completely, and you expect your care to be honored â€” not assumed.

You notice everything. The shift in tone, the unspoken tension, the way someone's words don't match their energy. You love through service, devotion, and emotional presence. You're not the type to shout your love â€” but you'll prove it daily, in ways only someone paying *real* attention will recognize.

In love, you are nurturing, loyal, and romantic in subtle, meaningful ways. You crave emotional safety, affection that's consistent, and a partner who sees the strength in your stillness. You don't fall easily, but when you do, your loyalty is deep â€” and your standards remain intact.

But if someone neglects your care, your loyalty becomes distance. You'll never beg to be understood. You'll just quietly disappear from emotional view â€” not to be cruel, but to protect your peace.

In work, you're dependable, creative, and deeply committed to excellence. You lead best with heart and detail â€” often building behind the scenes but holding more things together than most people ever realize. You thrive in spaces where care, meaning, and trust are valued.

In friendship and family, you're the safe haven â€” the emotional anchor others come to without even realizing why. You hold space, remember birthdays, offer thoughtful presence â€” and silently withdraw when your effort is no longer respected.
