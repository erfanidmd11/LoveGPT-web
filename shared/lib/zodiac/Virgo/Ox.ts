  fullNarrative: `
You are the quiet strength people wish for â€” grounded, responsible, emotionally mature, and loyal without conditions. You don't chase chaos. You don't perform for approval. You lead with action, with integrity, and with a heart that loves slowly â€” but with full commitment.

In love, you're practical, consistent, and affectionate in subtle, powerful ways. You may not be loud about your feelings, but when you love, it's in the way you remember what matters. In the way you protect, provide, and prove your loyalty with time, not talk.

You build love the way you build everything â€” with patience, intention, and follow-through. You want peace, not performance. Loyalty, not theatrics. And once you've given your loyalty, you guard that relationship like it's your life's work.

But you're also emotionally reserved. Vulnerability takes time. You'll hold space for your partner's feelings, but struggle to express your own. You internalize first â€” speak later. You'd rather solve than explain. But your love is steady, rooted, and real â€” once someone earns the right to receive it.

At work, you're focused, methodical, and often the one holding everything together behind the scenes. You thrive in stability, structure, and systems that reward patience and purpose. You don't need credit â€” you need results.

In friendship and family, you're the anchor. Reliable, thoughtful, quietly present. You may not say much â€” but when people need you, you're already there. But if your energy is taken for granted? You won't argue â€” you'll simply *stop showing up*.

  fullNarrative: `
You are elegance with endurance â€” composed, loyal, and devoted to the people and paths that feel right in your bones. You don't need grand displays to prove your love. You show it in your presence, in your follow-through, in the way you never let the people you care for fall through the cracks.

In love, you're steady, nurturing, and deeply loyal. You won't fall quickly â€” but once you do, it's with everything you've got. You believe in building trust, not demanding it. In showing up, not showing off. Your love language is consistency â€” and you expect your partner to meet you in that sacred rhythm.

You're not flashy, but you're unforgettable. Because your kind of loyalty is rare. You don't waver. You don't fake it. But you do *require respect* â€” and if someone mishandles your heart, they won't get a second chance. You exit quietly, but completely.

You feel deeply, but don't always express it. You carry your emotions in action more than words. You're emotionally resilient, but not emotionless. And when you feel safe? You offer a kind of emotional grounding that makes someone feel like home.

In work, you are structured, dependable, and quietly brilliant. You lead through precision, discipline, and the ability to get things done without needing attention for it. You build. You organize. You *hold it all together* â€” often without thanks, but always with pride.

In friendship and family, you're the silent glue. You show up without being asked. You give more than you take. But if your effort is unseen or taken for granted, you won't cause a scene â€” you'll quietly close your heart and move on without complaint.
