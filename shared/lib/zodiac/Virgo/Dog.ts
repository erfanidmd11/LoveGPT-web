  fullNarrative: `
You are loyalty in motion â€” calm, thoughtful, and built for love that doesn't need an audience. You're the one people count on, the one who remembers, who shows up, who stays. You don't perform love â€” you *live* it, through presence, protection, and principled devotion.

You don't fall fast, but you fall with *conviction*. In love, you're emotionally mature, consistent, and steady. You value depth over drama. Integrity over image. When you give your heart, it's because you've *thought it through*. And once you're in? You're all in.

You love with action. With showing up. With making someone feel safe â€” not just heard, but *held*. You're emotionally intelligent, but reserved. You feel deeply, but share carefully. If someone breaks your trust or disrespects your emotional boundaries, you don't argue. You *step back* â€” with clarity, not chaos.

At work, you're principled, precise, and quietly respected. You lead best through example, consistency, and grounded truth. You thrive in environments that reward discipline and service. You're rarely flashy â€” but always *essential*.

In family and friendships, you're dependable, emotionally solid, and the one people lean on. You offer support without needing credit â€” but when your care isn't reciprocated, you slowly retreat. You don't make scenes â€” you make decisions. And you don't come back from emotional disrespect twice.

  fullNarrative: `
You are the woman people trust without fully knowing why â€” calm, deeply present, emotionally wise, and loyal to the core. You're not loud, but you are *unmistakable*. You speak the truth gently, protect your people fiercely, and love with the kind of consistency that never needs performance.

In love, you're emotionally discerning, nurturing, and fiercely committed â€” but only once someone shows up with clarity and care. You don't do games. You don't do "almost." You love fully, or not at all. And once you've chosen someone? You give loyalty, warmth, and emotional depth that's rare in a world obsessed with fast feelings.

You love through devotion, support, and small, meaningful acts of care. But if your energy is taken for granted? You don't shout â€” you *disengage*. Not as punishment, but protection. Your love is sacred, and you won't spend it in places that don't value your peace.

You expect emotional maturity, mutual respect, and someone who values integrity as much as affection. You may be soft, but you are never naive. You'll give your all â€” but only to those who give something real in return.

In work, you're responsible, thoughtful, and principled. You thrive in environments where loyalty, trust, and meaningful service are honored. You're not driven by ego â€” you're driven by purpose. And it shows in everything you touch.

In friendships and family, you're the dependable one â€” the listener, the problem-solver, the one who shows up *without being asked*. But if your care is taken advantage of, your exit is graceful and final. You don't just love â€” you *protect*. But you've also learned when to protect yourself first.
