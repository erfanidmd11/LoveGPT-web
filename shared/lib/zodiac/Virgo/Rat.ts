  fullNarrative: `
You are structure with soul â€” deeply intelligent, emotionally perceptive, and impossible to fool. You lead with quiet observation. You don't chase attention, but you *know everything* that's going on. You're not here to impress â€” you're here to *understand*, to serve, to protect, and to *build*.

You don't rush into love â€” or anything. You observe. You assess. You wait until it feels right, then invest with depth and devotion. Your loyalty is sacred. Your word is bond. You may not be loud in love, but you are *constant*.

In relationships, you're steady, protective, and pragmatic. You won't write poems, but you'll show up when it matters. You'll remember the small things. You'll fix problems before they're spoken. You may not always express emotion easily, but when you love, you love through *action*.

But you're not here for emotional chaos. You crave peace, clarity, and trust. If someone plays games or crosses a line, you won't explode â€” you'll *vanish*. Not to cause drama, but because you simply don't stay where your peace isn't protected.

At work, you are strategic, competent, and highly efficient. You thrive in roles that value logic, planning, and quiet leadership. You're not after fame â€” you're after excellence. And you achieve it, every time, without ever needing a spotlight.

In family and friendships, you're loyal, protective, and practical. You won't overwhelm people with affection â€” but you'll be the one who shows up with solutions, with support, with presence. And when you're not appreciated? You withdraw with dignity â€” but decisively.

  fullNarrative: `
You are the calm voice in chaos â€” refined, emotionally observant, and grounded in quiet strength. You don't say much at first, but you *see everything*. You love through care, presence, and small details â€” not declarations. And once someone earns your trust? They gain a deeply loyal, emotionally generous woman who protects her love like it's sacred.

You don't love easily â€” you love *intentionally*. You assess energy, track behavior, and let people reveal themselves over time. You're not guarded because you're cold â€” you're guarded because your heart is *precious*, and you've learned what happens when it's given too quickly.

In love, you're loyal, thoughtful, and deeply supportive. You won't flood someone with affection â€” but you'll *show up* again and again, quietly making their world safer, softer, and more grounded. You crave connection that is emotionally mature, honest, and secure. If someone brings chaos or carelessness? You disappear â€” not dramatically, but fully.

You want real. A partner who understands nuance. Who sees past your composure and honors your quiet sensitivity. Someone who doesn't mistake your calm for indifference â€” and knows how to love a woman who doesn't need, but *chooses* to stay.

In work, you're highly capable, perceptive, and efficient. You thrive where excellence, detail, and emotional intelligence are valued. You prefer calm, structured environments â€” and lead best through example, not ego.

In friendships and family, you're the loyal listener, the problem-solver, the one who remembers the things no one else noticed. You don't need recognition â€” but you *do* need reciprocity. And if your effort isn't met with care? You shut down â€” gracefully, but completely.
