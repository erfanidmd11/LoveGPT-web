  fullNarrative: `
You are fire under control â€” bold in spirit, calm in presence, and always a few steps ahead of the noise. You don't speak unless it matters. You don't love casually. You're passionate, but not reckless. Every move you make is measured, meaningful, and backed by emotional depth you rarely expose.

You are emotionally intense â€” but intentional. You lead with logic, but love with ferocity. You don't play games â€” you play for keeps. And if someone earns your loyalty? They've gained a protector, a partner, and a man who never shows up halfway.

In love, you're passionate, loyal, and surprisingly sensitive beneath your structured surface. You want connection that's honest, intelligent, and emotionally alive. You don't need chaos â€” but you do need chemistry. You want someone who respects your mission, your mind, and knows how to hold space for your rare, vulnerable side.

You love through action. Through consistency. Through quiet protection. You're not the "I love you" ten times a day type. You're the "I showed up because I meant it" type. If someone crosses you emotionally? You won't argue. You'll just walk â€” and they won't get a second look.

At work, you are powerful, analytical, and often a quiet leader. You don't just want success â€” you want *meaning*. You thrive in mission-driven spaces, especially where focus, passion, and accountability are non-negotiables. People trust your judgment â€” even when they can't read your next move.

In friendships and family, you're protective, consistent, and often misunderstood at first. You give loyalty, support, and stability â€” and if someone meets you in that energy? You stay. But if your trust is broken, your withdrawal is silent, but permanent.

  fullNarrative: `
You are fire dressed in focus â€” sharp, protective, emotionally rich, and built to love *deeply* and lead with purpose. You're not here for casual, chaotic, or careless. You want love that has structure. Fire with direction. Passion *and* peace.

You love fiercely, but intentionally. You're emotionally complex â€” sensitive, loyal, and bold, all in the same breath. You don't give your heart easily, but when you do, it's sacred. You show up in ways few people know how to receive â€” unless they've done the work to hold space for someone like you.

In love, you're both a warrior and a nurturer. You'll protect your partner, push them to grow, and hold them with a kind of loyalty that doesn't need to be loud to be real. But if someone takes your energy for granted or underestimates your emotional depth, you won't explain yourself. You'll *walk*. Calmly. Elegantly. Forever.

You need a connection that feels grounded *and* electric. Someone who meets your intensity with steadiness â€” not insecurity. Someone who sees the softness under your structure and doesn't try to manage it â€” just respects it.

At work, you're strategic, impactful, and mission-driven. You don't chase titles â€” you chase impact. You bring vision with precision, and emotion with strategy. You lead best when your values align with your role â€” and you walk away when they don't.

In friendship and family, you're protective, present, and the one people turn to when they need grounding truth. You give fiercely, expect respect, and offer a love that's both healing and empowering. But when you're emotionally exhausted, your silence is the first â€” and last â€” warning.
