  fullNarrative: `
You are softness in structure â€” kind, observant, and grounded in thoughtful loyalty. You don't speak to impress â€” you speak to connect. You love with intention, think before you leap, and bring emotional presence that calms more than it consumes.

You offer quiet care. Deep listening. A protective energy that doesn't overpower â€” but surrounds. You're romantic in subtle, meaningful ways. The kind who remembers what someone said weeks ago and brings it back as an act of love â€” not a performance.

In love, you're loyal, attentive, and deeply affectionate once trust is built. You don't fall fast, but when you do, you fall *with devotion*. You want tenderness, stability, and a partner who honors the quiet intensity of your emotional world.

You're not into chaos or games. You want real. Safe. Sacred. And while your exterior may seem reserved, your heart is full of rich emotion â€” you just prefer to show it through action, not noise.

At work, you're dependable, thoughtful, and organized. You lead with compassion, follow through with care, and hold yourself to high standards â€” both ethically and emotionally. You thrive in environments where empathy and order coexist.

In friendships and family, you're the one who listens deeper. You show up without being asked. You care without making it about you. But if your emotional care isn't reciprocated? You begin to withdraw â€” slowly, gracefully, but decisively.

  fullNarrative: `
You are the soft presence that steadies the storm â€” gentle in delivery, exact in energy, and quietly rooted in emotional wisdom. You notice what others miss. You hold space with grace. And when you love, it's full-hearted, intentional, and deeply sacred.

You may seem delicate on the outside, but your boundaries are made of steel â€” forged through experience, protected by instinct. You love deeply, but not easily. You assess. You wait. You feel. And when it feels *right*, you give your heart in a way that changes the room.

In love, you are romantic, nurturing, and loyal â€” but discerning. You crave safety, stability, softness. You need someone who respects your rhythm, honors your intelligence, and sees that your quiet doesn't mean small â€” it means *real*.

If your care is overlooked or your energy disrespected, you won't lash out. You'll pull away â€” gently, gracefully, completely. Your exits are as elegant as your entrances â€” but they always mean something.

In work, you're thoughtful, creative, and highly capable. You bring emotional intelligence, design-minded thinking, and unmatched attention to detail. You thrive in peaceful, meaningful spaces â€” and avoid anything built on drama or ego.

In friendship and family, you're the emotional caretaker â€” the one who remembers, who listens deeply, who shows up without needing to be asked. But if your love is one-sided, your presence fades â€” not as punishment, but protection.
