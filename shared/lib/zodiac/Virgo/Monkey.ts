  fullNarrative: `
You are a mix of mischief and mindfulness â€” clever, emotionally aware, and far more grounded than your playful exterior suggests. You're the type who disarms people with a joke, reads the room faster than anyone else, and always has a quiet plan running in the background.

You love to laugh, connect, explore â€” but not without purpose. You're fun, yes, but not frivolous. You crave emotional safety, even if you pretend not to. You want to be understood *without having to explain every part of yourself* â€” and you're secretly hoping someone looks past the humor and sees the depth.

In love, you're flirtatious, surprising, and emotionally present in subtle ways. You remember what matters. You listen more than people realize. And you show up â€” when it counts. You're loyal, but not loud about it. You love through service, quick wit, and showing someone their world is more fun â€” and more stable â€” when you're in it.

But when you're hurt? You withdraw into jokes, distraction, or busyness. Vulnerability is earned. You'll give your heart â€” but only when you trust someone won't drop it. If you sense games or manipulation? You're out â€” not dramatically, but decisively.

In work, you're agile, articulate, and efficient. You're built for problem-solving, conversation, and innovation. You thrive when your mind is engaged, and when your ideas are given room to stretch. You lead with subtle authority â€” and results.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, emotionally tuned-in, and the one who brings levity â€” but also deep care. You may avoid drama, but you're always there when it matters. And if someone takes your emotional energy for granted? You simply *disengage* â€” no warning needed.

  fullNarrative: `
You are light with layers â€” quick-witted, emotionally insightful, and far more grounded than most realize. You make people laugh, think, and feel â€” often all in the same moment. You read the room better than anyone, and behind your sparkle is strategy. Behind your charm is care.

You love with intention, even if it comes wrapped in play. You flirt with mischief, speak with grace, and protect your heart with humor. But once someone earns your trust? They discover a woman who is deeply present, quietly loyal, and more emotionally tuned-in than she lets on.

In love, you are playful, romantic, and observant. You notice the little things. You connect quickly â€” but commit only when it feels emotionally clean. You want someone who sees past your charm and recognizes the devotion you're offering under the jokes and clever remarks.

If your effort is overlooked or your heart mishandled, you don't make noise â€” you *withdraw*. Not out of spite, but out of wisdom. You know how much you bring. And if someone doesn't? You'll give your warmth elsewhere.

At work, you're sharp, curious, and highly productive. You thrive in roles that give you both structure and space to innovate. You're collaborative, adaptive, and often the quiet engine behind success others take credit for â€” though they never forget *you* made it possible.

In family and friendship, you're the emotional shapeshifter â€” the one who shows up with levity, wisdom, or fierce loyalty depending on the need. You don't demand loyalty. You *model* it. And when your loyalty isn't returned? You simply stop offering your full self.
