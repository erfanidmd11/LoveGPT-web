  fullNarrative: `
You are structure with momentum â€” sharp, independent, and quietly intense. You lead with logic, live with passion, and crave a life (and love) that respects your freedom without sacrificing your depth. You're not chaotic â€” you're *restless*, in the best way. You move with purpose, and when you're emotionally invested, you're all in.

You're driven, observant, and more emotionally complex than you let on. You love experiences â€” but not the empty kind. You want adventure *and* meaning. You want chemistry *and* stability. You won't stay for comfort. You'll stay for growth â€” for trust â€” for something real.

In love, you're passionate, warm, and surprisingly attentive. You remember what matters. You listen between the lines. You give your loyalty slowly â€” but fiercely. And once someone earns it, you protect that connection with action, not just words.

But you need space. To think. To breathe. To be *you*. If someone gets clingy, manipulative, or tries to box you in, you shut down. Not with drama â€” with distance. And when you're gone, it takes more than just promises to bring you back.

At work, you're driven and flexible. You excel in environments that balance structure with creativity â€” places where your ideas can move. You lead with both focus and intuition, and you're often the one others come to when plans need clarity *and* momentum.

In family and friendship, you're reliable, supportive, and honest. You care deeply â€” but need people who can respect your rhythm. You give loyalty â€” but only when it's mutual. And if it's not? Your energy fades. Quietly. Permanently.

  fullNarrative: `
You are a free spirit in fine form â€” focused but fluid, romantic but realistic. You don't love fast â€” you love wisely. You don't need someone to complete you â€” you need someone who can *run beside you*, match your pace, and respect your space without mistaking it for emotional distance.

You lead with intelligence, walk with grace, and love with intention. You crave connection that's both passionate and peaceful â€” where fire doesn't mean drama, and loyalty doesn't mean being boxed in. You're fiercely loyal once someone earns your respect, but if they try to control you? You're out â€” elegantly, decisively, and without regret.

In love, you're independent, nurturing, and emotionally discerning. You give affection when it's earned, and consistency when it's mirrored. You want a partner who respects your strength, understands your rhythm, and offers love that doesn't suffocate your spark.

You need freedom *and* depth. You can be soft, but never submissive. You love affection, but not dependency. You're not here for half-effort â€” you're here for something meaningful that leaves room for both devotion and individuality.

In work, you thrive in spaces that allow flexibility, creativity, and mission-driven purpose. You're organized, intuitive, and have a quiet fire that people trust â€” even if they don't fully understand how you stay so composed under pressure.

In friendship and family, you're a fierce protector and soft confidante. You give generously â€” but only where loyalty flows both ways. If your care is taken for granted? You don't argue. You quietly adjust access â€” and move forward with grace.
