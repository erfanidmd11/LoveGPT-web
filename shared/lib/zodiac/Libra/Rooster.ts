  fullNarrative: `
You are elegance with edge â€” emotionally grounded, intellectually sharp, and loyal in ways that speak louder through action than performance. You live with clarity, lead with calm, and love with a kind of intention that makes others feel *safe, seen, and steady*.

In love, you're dependable, protective, and quietly affectionate. You build trust slowly, but when you're all in â€” you're *all in*. You express care through structure: in routines that show devotion, in support that doesn't need to be flashy, and in a loyalty that's unshakable when you feel emotionally safe.

You don't waste energy on drama. You seek depth, harmony, and someone who values emotional intelligence as much as charm. You want a partner who sees the beauty in your discipline â€” someone who respects your heart and your standards at the same time.

If your trust is broken or your effort is taken for granted, you don't explode â€” you *eject*. Silently. Completely. You don't give second chances to those who mishandle what you build.

At work, you're structured, responsible, and a quiet leader. You thrive in spaces that value order, principles, and consistent performance. You bring integrity to everything you touch â€” and people feel safer with you at the helm.

In friendships and family, you are loyal, grounded, and often the emotional backbone. You may not be the loudest â€” but you're the most reliable. If someone disrespects your values, you remove yourself without theatrics. Because your energy is sacred, and your peace is earned.

  fullNarrative: `
You are calm control â€” poised, emotionally wise, and fiercely loyal once your trust is earned. You love with clarity, build with intention, and move with a kind of grace that doesn't need to speak loudly to be deeply *felt*.

You hold yourself â€” and others â€” to high standards. Not from ego, but from honor. You believe in love that's mutual, meaningful, and emotionally clean. You don't play games. You don't chase chaos. You offer your heart with discernment, and once it's given â€” it's unwavering.

In love, you're loyal, nurturing, and structured. You give through quiet consistency, acts of care, and emotional devotion that is subtle but unshakable. You won't stay where you're taken for granted, and if someone disrupts your peace repeatedly â€” you remove yourself with composure, not conflict.

You don't fall fast, but when you do, it's thoughtful and real. You want a connection that balances heart and mind, love and logic, depth and stability. Someone who respects your inner order as much as your outer elegance.

At work, you are highly capable, values-driven, and detail-oriented. You lead through calm authority, empathy, and results. You may not seek the spotlight, but excellence follows you wherever you go.

In family and friendships, you're the foundation â€” steady, loyal, and emotionally responsible. You support without needing recognition. But if your care is taken for granted, you withdraw with grace â€” and rarely return to full emotional availability.
