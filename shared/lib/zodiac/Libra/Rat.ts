  fullNarrative: `
You are charm with calculation â€” graceful, diplomatic, and far more emotionally strategic than people realize at first glance. You know how to connect, how to talk, how to listen â€” and how to quietly size up what's *really* going on beneath the surface.

You don't rush into love. You assess. You observe. You flirt with finesse but love with intention. When you commit, it's because something clicked on a soul level â€” and once you're in, you're loyal, devoted, and incredibly supportive. You don't perform love â€” you invest in it.

In relationships, you're romantic, communicative, and subtly protective. You offer balance, perspective, and emotional safety. You don't want chaos â€” you want chemistry *and* clarity. You're more sensitive than you appear, but you hide it under cool logic and polished delivery.

If someone disrespects your trust or emotional rhythm, you don't explode â€” you *eject*. Quickly, quietly, and with finality. And no, you don't take the detour through closure if someone didn't show up with the same energy you gave.

At work, you're insightful, persuasive, and intelligent. You thrive where creativity meets logic â€” in roles where people, beauty, and systems intersect. You're diplomatic but precise. People trust you because you're clear â€” even when you're calm.

In friendships and family, you're thoughtful, charming, and emotionally observant. You won't always say what's wrong, but you'll *know* â€” and you'll protect your peace accordingly. If someone drains your energy? You'll fade â€” not to punish, but to realign with yourself.

  fullNarrative: `
You are light with depth â€” charming, intuitive, and always in tune with the emotional temperature of the room. You don't just sense energy â€” you *read it*, and often see the truth before anyone else has caught on. You're warm, wise, and softly strategic â€” a woman who moves with elegance and emotional discernment.

In love, you're romantic, thoughtful, and deeply present â€” once someone earns your trust. You don't fall for surface-level charm. You want real substance, emotional honesty, and someone who shows up consistently. When you love, you give grace, loyalty, and your full attention â€” but if you feel unappreciated or emotionally off-balance, you pull back. Not to punish â€” to protect.

You want peace *and* passion. A connection that feels emotionally clean, intellectually engaging, and spiritually nourishing. You love deeply â€” but you never chase. If someone can't meet your depth, your absence will say everything your words never needed to.

At work, you're collaborative, intelligent, and driven by balance. You thrive in environments that value communication, elegance, and efficiency. You lead through diplomacy and insight â€” rarely loud, but always heard.

In friendships and family, you're the one who remembers the little things. You offer emotional clarity, support, and quiet loyalty. But if you feel taken for granted, you don't argue â€” you *elevate* and move on. With grace. And no warning.
