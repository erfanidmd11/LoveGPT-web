  fullNarrative: `
You are tenderness wrapped in intention â€” thoughtful, emotionally intelligent, and quietly powerful in the way you show up for those you love. You don't perform affection. You live it â€” through your patience, your presence, and your deep respect for emotional nuance.

You feel everything â€” and while you may not always say it, you express it through kindness, creativity, and the emotional sanctuary you build around the people you care for. You're loyal, gentle, and often underestimated â€” until someone experiences how fiercely you protect what feels sacred to you.

In love, you're romantic, nurturing, and quietly consistent. You're not here for chaos or performance. You want connection that's emotionally clean, spiritually grounding, and safe enough for you to show your *entire* heart. You don't rush â€” but when you trust? You give everything.

But if your loyalty is taken for granted, your retreat is slow and subtle â€” and rarely reversible. You don't love lightly. You don't leave lightly. But when you go, it's always because your soul made the decision before your words ever could.

In work, you're creative, collaborative, and emotionally in tune with your environment. You thrive in spaces where care and craft are valued over speed and ego. You don't need to lead loudly â€” you lead through presence, thoughtfulness, and quiet impact.

In family and friendship, you're nurturing, attentive, and deeply loyal. You support in ways others don't even notice â€” and often don't ask for anything in return. But when your love isn't mirrored, you fade â€” not out of punishment, but self-preservation.

  fullNarrative: `
You are elegance with endurance â€” emotionally wise, artistically attuned, and deeply loyal to love that feels peaceful, purposeful, and *real*. You don't offer your heart easily â€” but once you do, it's with a depth few can match.

You don't just love â€” you *nurture*. You create a safe space. You remember the little things. You notice what's left unsaid. You're romantic, but not in a showy way. Your love lives in your care, your softness, and your fierce consistency.

You crave connection that's emotionally safe, spiritually honest, and mutually supportive. You're loyal by choice â€” and protective by instinct. If someone takes your peace or your loyalty for granted? You'll walk away quietly. No drama. Just a closed door that doesn't reopen.

In love, you're affectionate, gentle, and quietly romantic. You offer devotion in small, beautiful ways â€” but expect emotional reciprocity. You don't need everything to be perfect â€” just *real*. You can handle flaws, but not fakes.

In work, you thrive in emotionally intelligent, creative, or collaborative environments. You lead with vision, intuition, and quiet influence. You're often the unshakable center in a team that didn't realize they were orbiting your balance.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, supportive, and emotionally giving. You offer love without needing praise, and support without needing permission. But when your energy is consistently taken without return? Your absence becomes your answer.
