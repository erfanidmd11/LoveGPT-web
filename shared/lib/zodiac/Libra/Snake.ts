  fullNarrative: `
You are precision in a velvet suit â€” charming, emotionally refined, and deeply strategic in love and life. You move with subtle power, speak with intent, and build trust like a craftsman â€” slowly, carefully, but with the intention to make it *last*.

You feel deeply, but only express when it feels safe. You love through calm consistency, attentiveness, and a subtle but steady devotion that proves itself over time. You don't rush into anything. You observe. You analyze. You test before you trust â€” and once someone passes, you're all in.

In love, you're a patient romantic. You give through presence, loyalty, and thoughtful gestures. You're selective â€” not because you fear love, but because you *respect it*. And you expect your partner to do the same.

You need emotional balance. Clarity. Emotional safety. If the connection feels chaotic or insincere, you retreat â€” quietly, completely, and without second chances. You're not dramatic. You're *done*.

At work, you're composed, analytical, and persuasive. You excel in environments where your sharp mind and quiet confidence are respected. You lead without shouting â€” but your results always speak volumes.

In family and friendship, you're thoughtful, protective, and loyal. You show love without noise â€” but it's always felt. You expect reciprocity â€” and if it's not there, you won't demand it. You'll just withdraw, protect your energy, and move forward with grace.

  fullNarrative: `
You are mystery wrapped in elegance â€” composed, emotionally precise, and loyal to the people and energy that respect your pace, your peace, and your presence. You don't need attention to feel powerful â€” you move in silence and still hold the room.

You're soft when it's safe, sharp when it's earned, and discerning in every connection you allow. In love, you're emotionally intelligent, fiercely loyal, and deeply sensual â€” but only once you trust someone can hold your heart with care and maturity. You test energy first. Words are nice. Behavior is truth.

You don't offer your emotions easily. But when you do? It's sacred. You give through quiet devotion, through subtle gestures, through energy that says "I'm here" even when your words are minimal. You don't fall quickly â€” but when you do, your loyalty is unwavering.

You're not here for chaos or emotional immaturity. You crave presence. Mutual respect. Realness. If someone brings confusion to your clarity, or inconsistency to your calm, you disappear. Not out of anger â€” but alignment.

At work, you're polished, analytical, and precise. You excel in environments where your intellect and emotional awareness are strengths â€” not liabilities. You lead best behind the scenes, where power is quiet and performance is consistent.

In friendship and family, you are protective, loyal, and deeply insightful. You notice what others miss. You offer love without needing the spotlight. But if your care is not reciprocated, your boundary arrives wrapped in grace â€” but firm and final.
