  fullNarrative: `
You are peace in a world that moves too fast â€” thoughtful, loyal, and emotionally grounded in a way that makes people feel instantly safe. You don't rush love. You *build* it. Slowly. Intentionally. With clarity and devotion that doesn't need to be loud to be lasting.

In love, you're calm, consistent, and deeply loyal. You don't overpromise â€” you *show up*. Your affection is steady, your standards are strong, and your presence speaks louder than any big romantic speech. You value substance, honesty, and peace. And when you give your heart, you protect what you've built like it's sacred.

You aren't here for performance. You're here for partnership â€” something rooted in effort, respect, and long-term energy. You don't need constant excitement â€” but you do need *emotional truth*. If someone disrespects your boundaries or brings too much instability, you don't argue. You *exit* â€” firmly, gracefully, and without second chances.

At work, you're reliable, focused, and purpose-driven. You thrive in structured, ethical environments where your precision and integrity are assets. You prefer doing things right over doing them fast â€” and you're often the reason people around you feel anchored.

In family and friendship, you're steady, protective, and emotionally solid. You may not be overly expressive, but your loyalty is felt. You show up without needing to be asked. But if your care is taken for granted, you withdraw without explanation â€” and rarely return to the same depth twice.

  fullNarrative: `
You are elegance with quiet power â€” structured, grounded, and fiercely loyal in a way that never begs to be seen. You move through life with thoughtfulness and purpose, giving your heart only where there's respect, emotional safety, and something *real* being built.

You're not drawn to chaos or empty charm. You want connection that feels stable and soulful â€” the kind where effort is shared, and love is shown through presence, not just passion. When you love, you're devoted. You're consistent. And you protect the space you've created like a sacred home.

In love, you're emotionally intelligent, romantic in intentional ways, and quietly protective. You give through structure: your time, your care, your loyalty. You remember the details. You bring balance. But if your peace is disturbed too often? You don't argue â€” you simply step away.

You don't do half-loves. You do deep commitment â€” or distance. There's no in-between. You're soft, but you're not fragile. And your boundaries are both invisible and immovable once someone breaks trust.

At work, you're dependable, efficient, and often the quiet leader. You organize, stabilize, and elevate â€” not with noise, but with precision. You thrive in roles where structure and heart meet â€” where excellence matters *and* people feel safe.

In friendships and family, you are grounding, loyal, and the one who's always thinking three steps ahead. You won't always say what's wrong â€” but you always *know*. If someone disrespects your care? You don't explain. You *exit* with grace.
