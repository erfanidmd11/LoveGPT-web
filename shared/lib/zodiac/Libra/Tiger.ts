  fullNarrative: `
You are passion with polish â€” magnetic, bold, and impossible to ignore. You lead with charm, love with heart, and bring fire to every connection you *actually care about*. You don't fake interest. You don't do surface-level. You want real. You want movement. You want love that both *grounds* and *ignites*.

You love fast â€” but not carelessly. You assess quickly, feel deeply, and give everything when your spirit says "yes." You crave emotional depth with balance. Intensity with truth. Loyalty without control. And when someone earns your heart? They get a partner who's present, powerful, and unwavering â€” even if a little unpredictable.

You give love through action, attention, and fierce emotional loyalty. You're playful, flirtatious, but emotionally *serious* about who you choose. If that love isn't honored or mirrored? You pull back hard â€” and rarely return.

In work, you're driven, creative, and instinctively strategic. You thrive in spaces that give you the freedom to lead, innovate, and connect. You don't follow â€” you *inspire*. And when purpose meets passion? You're unstoppable.

In friendships and family, you're warm, loyal, and often the emotional pulse of the room. You'll defend those you love â€” but also challenge them to rise. You give big â€” but expect emotional honesty in return. You don't have time for half-love, half-truth, or emotional games.

  fullNarrative: `
You are elegance with a roar â€” charming, emotionally intense, and unapologetically true to what (and who) sets your soul on fire. You don't shrink to be loved â€” you *rise*, and you expect a partner who can rise with you.

You feel everything â€” and express it boldly. You don't love halfway. When your heart says yes, it says *all in*. You offer depth, passion, affection, and loyalty that runs deeper than most people are ready for. But if someone crosses your trust? You don't yell. You *walk* â€” with grace, fire, and no need to explain twice.

In love, you're flirtatious, generous, and emotionally honest. You want connection that excites *and* grounds you. You crave a partner who sees you â€” not just your beauty or spark, but your drive, your loyalty, your storm. You need honesty, mutual respect, and someone who understands that behind your charm is a woman who *feels deeply and chooses deliberately*.

You'll give your all to someone who mirrors your energy. But if they fall short repeatedly, your silence will be louder than any goodbye. Your peace is earned. Your loyalty, sacred.

In work, you're ambitious, magnetic, and emotionally intelligent. You lead through presence and persuasion. You do well in environments that respect your voice, your creativity, and your autonomy. You don't just follow dreams â€” you *build them*.

In friendship and family, you're the protector and the spark. You show up when it matters, defend what's yours, and inspire others to own their truth. But if your emotional generosity isn't honored? You pull back swiftly, and your exit always leaves a mark.
