You are charisma in motion â€” confident, passionate, and emotionally attuned in a way that makes you unforgettable. You know how to talk, how to connect, how to move â€” but only when it *feels real*. You're not here to be caged, but you *are* here to commit â€” once freedom and trust coexist.

In love, you're expressive, romantic, and independent. You show affection through presence, playfulness, and thoughtful intention. You want passion *and* peace. Excitement *and* consistency. A partner who runs beside you â€” not behind you, and definitely not in your way.

You're loyal, but only when your spirit feels safe. If a connection starts to feel controlling or emotionally rigid, you pull back. Not to play games â€” but because your freedom isn't a luxury. It's how your heart stays open.

You give deeply, but you guard your peace. You love connection, but only the kind that respects your rhythm. If someone shows up with maturity and mutual respect? You give your all. But if they come with confusion or possessiveness, you quietly step away â€” no chase, no drama.

In work, you're creative, adaptable, and magnetic. You lead with vision and thrive in roles that give you space to move, build, and innovate. Structure helps you focus â€” but too much of it dims your fire.

In friendships and family, you're warm, loyal, and generous. You bring levity, support, and movement. You don't always linger in emotional heaviness, but when it matters â€” you *show up*. If someone earns your trust, you're fiercely devoted. If they take you for granted? You disappear before they realize what they lost.

  fullNarrative: `
You are elegance in motion â€” confident, emotionally perceptive, and magnetically free. You love with energy, lead with grace, and live with a kind of emotional rhythm that draws people in before they even know why.

You don't do love halfway. You want truth, depth, and someone who sees *you* â€” not just your beauty, but your brilliance. You'll give your all to someone who gives freedom without distance, passion without pressure, and presence without possession.

In love, you're expressive, loyal, and emotionally intuitive. You know what you want â€” and you won't stay long where you're not respected or *seen*. You love adventure and connection in equal measure. You need space, but you also need soul. And the one who earns your heart gets a partner who is devoted, creative, and full of fire â€” but never needy.

You don't tolerate inconsistency. You test it â€” with silence. With emotional shift. And if someone can't meet you where you are? You don't explain. You *exit*. Softly. Swiftly. Completely.

In work, you're strategic, social, and driven by purpose. You do best in environments that give you space to create, connect, and lead with emotional intelligence. You don't like being boxed in. You like building your own lane â€” with style and impact.

In family and friendship, you're loyal, supportive, and inspiring. You're the one who brings the spark and the soul. But if your energy is drained or your needs dismissed? Your absence becomes louder than any confrontation ever could.
