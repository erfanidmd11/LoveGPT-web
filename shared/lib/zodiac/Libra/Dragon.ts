  fullNarrative: `
You are presence with a pulse â€” bold, emotionally aware, and driven by connection that matches your intensity and vision. You walk into a room and shift the energy. Not just with charm, but with *clarity*. You know what you want â€” and who you are.

In love, you're expressive, protective, and powerfully devoted. You lead with confidence, but beneath the bravado is a heart that wants depth, not drama. You fall for someone who balances your strength with softness â€” someone who sees behind the spark to the substance.

You're loyal. Not blindly, but with intention. Once you commit, you commit with your whole being. You don't need performance â€” you need presence. You want a love that holds fire and steadiness together â€” and if it starts to slip into games or inconsistency, you step away. No second warnings. No chase.

You crave a partner who elevates your purpose â€” someone who isn't intimidated by your power, but inspired by it. Someone who respects your leadership, but also knows how to *stand beside you*, not just behind.

At work, you're a natural leader. Visionary, articulate, emotionally intelligent. You're driven by impact â€” not just success. People trust your direction, even when they don't always understand it at first. You lead because you *care* â€” and because your standards refuse to be average.

In friendship and family, you're the protector and the motivator. You challenge your people to level up â€” but only because you believe in them. But if your loyalty is disrespected? You disappear quickly â€” and don't reopen the door.

You are grace with fire â€” commanding, emotionally perceptive, and unwavering in your truth. You don't just attract attention â€” you *command it*. Not with force, but with presence. With standards. With soul. You love with all your energy, but never without discernment.

You offer a rare mix of elegance and emotional intensity. You're soft when it's safe, fierce when it's not, and you *don't apologize* for knowing your worth. You want partnership, not pedestal. You want connection that's real, not just convenient.

In love, you are devoted, magnetic, and fiercely protective. You offer deep loyalty â€” but only once someone proves they're ready for the kind of truth and fire you bring. You lead with heart, but stay grounded in reason. If someone tries to tame your energy or minimize your emotions, they'll meet the exit *before* the explanation.

You want depth. Stability. Emotional accountability. You crave passion that builds, not burns out. And if someone shows up halfway? You won't chase. You'll rise â€” without looking back.

At work, you're sharp, poised, and visionary. You move with strategy, speak with intention, and lead with both conviction and care. You don't need the spotlight â€” but it tends to follow you anyway.

In friendship and family, you're loyal, protective, and full of emotional presence. You offer support with strength â€” but also expect your energy to be honored. If it's not? Your boundaries arrive like silk-wrapped armor: beautiful, but firm.
