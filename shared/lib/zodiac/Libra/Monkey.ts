  fullNarrative: `
You are intellect with sparkle â€” sharp, charming, emotionally insightful, and full of quiet loyalty under all the lighthearted laughter. You don't just want love â€” you want connection that makes you *think*, *feel*, and *laugh at the madness of it all*.

In love, you're affectionate, flirty, and highly intuitive. You pick up on energy fast. You know when something's off â€” even if you joke through it at first. You want a partner who understands that behind your humor is a heart that *feels deeply and chooses carefully*.

You give loyalty â€” once someone proves they can match your energy *and* your emotional awareness. You want balance: freedom without distance, conversation without performance, trust without pressure. If someone tries to control or dull your fire, you step back â€” silently, but definitively.

You're loyal to those who get the real you â€” the version behind the wit. You love through actions, timing, attentiveness, and surprising softness when the moment calls for it. You don't overshare â€” but when you open up, it's honest, tender, and real.

In work, you're flexible, creative, and naturally persuasive. You thrive in roles that value people, communication, and innovation. You're a natural leader â€” not because you force it, but because your presence *makes things better*.

In friendships and family, you're the joyful connector, the problem-solver, the one who breaks tension with humor but never forgets the emotional undercurrent. When someone needs you, you *show up*. And if you're taken for granted? You fade â€” quietly, but fully.

  fullNarrative: `
You are charm with layers â€” vibrant, clever, and more emotionally attuned than most ever realize. You lead with lightness, but behind your wit is a mind that doesn't miss *anything*. You love fully â€” but only when someone sees past your sparkle to the softness you don't often show.

In love, you're playful, magnetic, and quick to connect â€” but slow to trust. You crave affection, laughter, and spontaneity, but also require loyalty, depth, and emotional presence. You don't stay where your light is used but not *seen*.

You give generously â€” in energy, time, attention â€” but you need someone who mirrors that with honesty and curiosity, not control. If things feel off, you'll test the waters with space or sarcasm before you show your vulnerability. And if that vulnerability isn't respected? You vanish. With grace. And without second chances.

You love freedom and flow, but you're not flaky. When you choose someone, you stay â€” fiercely, joyfully, and with surprising emotional depth. Your loyalty is quiet but unshakable once you feel safe.

In work, you're creative, fast-thinking, and persuasive. You bring ideas and solutions, and you often lead with subtle influence. You shine in flexible environments where people skills and originality are assets â€” and you lose interest fast in anything repetitive or emotionally flat.

In friendships and family, you're the fun one, the smart one, and the one who always knows when something's *off* â€” even if no one else does. You give your care through energy and humor, but when your emotional effort isn't mirrored, you quietly pull back.
