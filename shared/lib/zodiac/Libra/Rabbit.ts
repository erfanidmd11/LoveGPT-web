  fullNarrative: `
You are softness with soul â€” emotionally attuned, thoughtful, and deeply romantic in quiet, consistent ways. You don't rush connection. You observe. You feel. You speak through kindness, charm, and small acts that say "you matter" without needing to say much at all.

In love, you're devoted, affectionate, and subtly protective. You don't give your heart easily â€” but once you do, it's all in. You want emotional safety, gentle consistency, and a partner who meets your tenderness with presence, not pressure.

You're graceful and diplomatic, but that doesn't mean passive. If someone disrespects your peace or takes your loyalty for granted, your retreat is subtle, graceful â€” and complete.

In work, you thrive in collaborative, creative, or emotionally intelligent spaces. You lead through intuition and care, not command. You're rarely loud â€” but always *felt*.

In friendships and family, you're the emotional anchor â€” the one who remembers, who notices, who gives more than they say. But if you're emotionally drained, your silence speaks volumes. You don't need attention â€” you need reciprocity.

 ],
  fullNarrative: `
You are light wrapped in wisdom â€” graceful, emotionally attuned, and radiant in the way you love and move through life. You carry care like an art form. You don't demand attention. You attract it â€” through presence, through poise, through a heart that speaks softly but stays loud in the lives of those who earn it.

In love, you're nurturing, romantic, and emotionally selective. You give slowly, but when you do, it's full-hearted and sacred. You want connection that feels soft, emotionally clean, and spiritually mutual. You'll give the world to the one who makes you feel *safe enough to stay*.

But your peace is sacred. If your heart is mishandled or your grace disrespected? You leave with elegance and finality. Not to prove anything â€” to protect everything.

In work, you're collaborative, creative, and emotionally precise. You lead through empathy, vision, and subtle influence. Your strength doesn't shout â€” it *shapes*.

In family and friendship, you're the one who remembers, who softens the sharp edges, who offers love without ego. But when you're taken for granted? Your energy disappears before your words do.
