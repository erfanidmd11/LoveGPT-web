  fullNarrative: `
You are a rare mix of grounded loyalty and intellectual agility. People may come for your charm and quick mind â€” but they stay for your integrity. You speak honestly, listen carefully, and show up with your full self when you believe in something â€” or someone.

You are equal parts curious and committed. You don't do anything halfway â€” especially when it comes to love or loyalty. You need mental stimulation and emotional clarity. You thrive in connection that's honest, kind, and free from emotional games.

In love, you're a thoughtful and principled partner. You're romantic â€” in the small, specific ways: in the details you remember, in the words you choose, in the space you hold. But you also have standards. If someone starts playing with your trust or peace? You'll call it out once, and if it continues â€” you're gone. No explosion. Just a well-timed exit.

You're emotionally intelligent but can sometimes intellectualize your own feelings. You'd rather *explain* what you're feeling than just *feel it*. But when someone creates a space safe enough for you to show up messy? You're all in â€” and loyal to the core.

At work, you're reliable, adaptable, and quietly driven. You excel in roles where honesty, collaboration, and communication matter. You're the team member who holds people accountable while keeping the vibe grounded and productive.

In friendships and family, you're the one who keeps it real. You show up. You hold the line. You love with presence â€” but expect respect in return. You don't like being taken for granted, and your boundaries are clear, even if you rarely raise your voice.

  fullNarrative: `
You are clarity with compassion â€” a woman who balances heart and head without losing her rhythm. You communicate with precision, love with intention, and never mistake attention for affection. Your standards are high â€” not because you're hard to love, but because you know your value without needing it to be proven by anyone else.

You're witty, emotionally honest, and grounded in your truth. You want real connection â€” not romance dressed up in chaos. You don't do performative love. You do *earned intimacy*. If someone shows up with presence, clarity, and emotional maturity? You give everything. But if someone plays games? You won't say much â€” just stop participating.

In love, you're protective, loyal, and consistent. You'll call someone out gently but firmly when needed. You notice patterns, track tone, and respond to energy. You need someone who doesn't flinch when things get serious â€” someone who's in it with you, not just beside you.

You give love through conversation, thoughtful acts, and quiet loyalty. You don't love loudly â€” but you love deeply. And when you're not being met emotionally, you'll pull back fast â€” not for revenge, but for *preservation*.

In work and purpose, you're smart, dependable, and principled. You bring emotional awareness and verbal precision to everything you do. People trust you because you show up with integrity. You don't bend just to belong â€” and you quietly expect the same from others.

In family and friendships, you're present, dependable, and emotionally mature. You'll listen, support, and help people get to the root of what they're feeling â€” but if they drain you without reciprocation? You'll retreat, protect your peace, and rebuild your boundaries.
