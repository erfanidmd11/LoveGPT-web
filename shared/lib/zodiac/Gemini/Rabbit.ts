  fullNarrative: `
You are grace wrapped in cleverness â€” soft-spoken when needed, but sharp when it counts. You don't overpower the room. You *disarm* it. People trust you quickly â€” not just because of how you speak, but because of how well you *listen*. You're the man who makes people feel seen, heard, and slightly enchanted.

You're emotionally aware and socially agile. You can shift the energy in a room just by leaning in. You're flirtatious, articulate, and endlessly curious. You don't just make conversation â€” you *curate connection*. But under the charm is someone more sensitive than he lets on.

In love, you're romantic, devoted, and quietly intense â€” but only once someone earns your trust. You fall in love with presence, attention, subtlety. You don't want loud declarations â€” you want consistency, warmth, and shared softness. You love with thoughtful gestures, late-night talks, and subtle loyalty.

But you guard your heart behind humor and helpfulness. You might downplay your needs. You might give more than you ask for. You might stay silent when what you really want is to be reassured. You long for emotional safety â€” but you're slow to say so.

In work and life, you bring creativity, diplomacy, and intuition. You do best in roles that blend intellect and emotional intelligence â€” anything that allows space to create, connect, and *feel*. You're not built for chaos. You prefer calm. But you can adapt to almost anything â€” that's part of your quiet brilliance.

In family and friendship, you're the emotional anchor no one expected. You offer insight, gentle presence, and humor that defuses tension. But when you feel ignored, unappreciated, or unseen? You disappear without slamming the door â€” you just never come back.

  fullNarrative: `
You are softness with a spark â€” a woman who speaks in poetry but reads the room like a map. People are enchanted by your charm, your kindness, your laughter... and completely unaware of how *little* you reveal until you decide they've earned it.

You are emotionally intelligent, verbally gifted, and effortlessly graceful. You flirt without trying. You listen deeply. You reflect emotion with precision. But while others are talking, you're *observing* â€” gently, quietly, and never without intention.

In love, you're romantic, attentive, and naturally affectionate. But you are also private. You offer depth in doses â€” thoughtful, tender, and calculated. You don't fall for volume. You fall for consistency, care, and connection that feels *real* beneath the words. You need emotional safety, not just attraction.

You will give your whole heart to someone who sees you â€” but if they try to control you, misunderstand your silence, or disregard your depth, you'll vanish like a breeze through an open window. Not to hurt them â€” just to protect you.

In work and creativity, you shine in spaces where beauty, intellect, and emotional nuance matter. You're collaborative, insightful, and a quiet powerhouse when supported. You dislike conflict but value truth â€” especially when it's spoken with care.

In family and close relationships, you're the gentle anchor. You show up with gifts, humor, softness, and thoughtful questions. You offer presence â€” not performance. But you'll quietly withdraw if the space stops feeling emotionally reciprocal.
