  fullNarrative: `
You are a gentle rebel â€” an emotional mind wrapped in charm, creativity, and contradiction. You think fast, feel deeply, and live in poetic tension between your craving for connection and your fear of losing yourself in it.

People often meet your wit first â€” the easy smile, the quick jokes, the way you make people feel like they've known you forever. But behind that charisma is a heart that's both tender and guarded, playful and reflective. You love deeply â€” but selectively. And when you're hurt? You vanish, not to punish, but to protect your inner world.

In love, you're romantic, idealistic, and emotionally attentive â€” until you're misunderstood. You need affection, creativity, space, and a partner who knows how to hold your softness without trying to manage it. You're drawn to beauty in all its forms â€” words, emotion, connection â€” and you need relationships that nourish more than just your body or mind.

But you struggle with staying grounded when things get emotionally heavy. You'll disappear into thought, into solitude, into a new project or fantasy â€” anything to avoid emotional confrontation. You want deep love, but you also want to *survive it*.

In career, you're creative, empathetic, and easily inspired â€” but you need freedom. You shine when you feel emotionally safe and intellectually respected. You may gravitate toward artistic, healing, or emotionally expressive work. Routine can stifle you. Inspiration wakes you up.

In friendships and family, you're nurturing, present, and often the emotional translator â€” helping people say what they feel before they even know what that is. But you're sensitive to imbalance. You give a lot emotionally â€” but if it's not reciprocated, your distance will arrive before your explanation.

  fullNarrative: `
You are the whisper that changes the room â€” soft, artistic, emotionally intelligent, and mysteriously captivating. You don't yell to be heard â€” people lean in because your presence speaks before your words ever do. You are equal parts whimsy and wisdom â€” a dreamer with strong roots and a smile that hides entire worlds.

You love through small things â€” thoughtful words, soft touches, remembering what no one else noticed. You offer depth without force. Magic without performance. But you're not naive. You *know* when your energy is being misread â€” and when it is, you don't argue. You simply retreat.

In love, you're gentle, affectionate, romantic, and intuitive. You read between the lines with ease. You can sense emotional shifts before they're spoken. And while you may come across as dreamy, your emotional boundaries are real. You want tenderness, yes â€” but you also want truth. Consistency. Safety. And someone who doesn't treat your softness as fragility.

You'll give endlessly to the right person â€” until you realize you're giving alone. Then? You'll leave so gently that they won't realize it until they feel your absence more than they ever felt your presence.

In work and creativity, you're emotionally intelligent, aesthetically attuned, and quietly ambitious. You're drawn to environments where connection, beauty, or healing are at the center. You dislike conflict and thrive in harmonious settings where you can *create*, not just execute.

In family and friendships, you're the one who senses what others can't say. The emotional translator. The gentle holder of space. But you need reciprocity. You give from your heart â€” but if no one notices the quiet effort behind your presence, your silence will say everything.
