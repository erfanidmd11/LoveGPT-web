  fullNarrative: `
You are logic with a touch of rebellion â€” someone who thinks fast but builds slow. You balance intellect with consistency, communication with control. You might not be loud, but you're the guy who makes things *happen*. People underestimate your charisma â€” until they realize it's *calculated*.

You're a thinker. A planner. A doer. You get things done â€” even if you don't always announce what you're working on. You see both the big picture and the small cracks, and you solve problems with precision, not drama. Your work ethic is sharp. Your self-discipline is serious. And your charm? Subtle, but effective.

In love, you're dependable, thoughtful, and emotionally reserved â€” until someone earns your trust. You don't fall fast, but when you do, it's with loyalty and long-term vision. You love with action: follow-through, support, structure. You're not overly expressive, but you're deeply reliable. You want a partner who brings emotional warmth without chaos.

You struggle with emotional vulnerability. You tend to intellectualize your feelings. You're more likely to write a list about how someone hurt you than to actually tell them. But when you feel safe? Your emotional generosity is steady and profound.

Professionally, you're disciplined, analytical, and strategic. You thrive in roles that reward structure, logic, and measurable success. You're not here for flash â€” you're here for *foundation*. You climb slowly, but with intention. And when you arrive? You *own* the space.

In family and friendships, you're loyal, principled, and protective â€” but you expect people to hold themselves accountable. You're not here to babysit anyone's growth. You're here to support those who *show up* with intention.

  fullNarrative: `
You are grace with a filter â€” sharp, structured, and impossible to manipulate. You read people fast. You don't play games â€” unless you designed the rules. You're emotionally aware, socially skilled, and careful with your energy. You move with poise, think with clarity, and love *only with intention*.

You are what happens when intellect meets elegance. You process quickly but act slowly. You gather data â€” from people, from spaces, from silences â€” before making your move. You're charming in a quiet way, persuasive without effort, and calm even when the room is spinning.

In love, you are loyal, sensual, and extremely selective. You don't fall easily, and when you do, it's because someone *earned* it â€” not because they impressed you with a show. You're affectionate, but not needy. Present, but not overwhelming. You love through presence, thoughtfulness, and emotional boundaries that keep the connection clean and intentional.

You value clarity in romance. You crave real conversation, mutual respect, emotional consistency. But if someone crosses your standards? You don't shout. You step back. Gracefully. Without returning.

At work, you're grounded, efficient, and clear-headed. You're the one who remembers what others forget, fixes what others missed, and gets it done *without the drama*. You lead with focus. You thrive in structure. And you work best when you're trusted to move at your pace â€” not forced into someone else's chaos.

In family and friendship, you're the anchor â€” thoughtful, practical, and fiercely loyal to your inner circle. But emotional energy is sacred to you. You won't tolerate repeated emotional messiness. You'll help â€” once. Twice, maybe. Then the boundary comes down.
