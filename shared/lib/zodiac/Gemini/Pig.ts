  fullNarrative: `
You are the heart wrapped in humor â€” sweet, smart, and surprisingly deep beneath the charm. You speak like poetry in motion, flirt like it's an art form, and connect with people easily â€” not because you're trying, but because you *mean it*. You radiate warmth and carry a softness that people don't expect from someone so *on*.

You lead with kindness and charisma. You love to make people laugh, feel safe, feel *seen*. But your tenderness is not naÃ¯vetÃ© â€” it's a choice. You feel deeply, but you hide behind lightness when the feelings feel *too much*.

In love, you're expressive, giving, romantic, and slightly idealistic. You love grand gestures and thoughtful details. You want to be appreciated for your heart, your loyalty, and your ability to make someone feel like the center of your world. But if that love isn't mirrored or emotionally safe? You spiral into doubt and disappear â€” not out of manipulation, but out of self-protection.

You're generous to a fault â€” with time, emotion, affection. But you expect that generosity to be noticed, and if it isn't? Your hurt shows up in silence, or sometimes, in over-giving just to prove your worth.

Professionally, you're collaborative, emotionally intelligent, and often under-recognized because your humility hides your brilliance. You're creative, communicative, and best in environments that allow heart, humor, and humanity. You're a natural team builder, not just a solo star.

In friendships and family, you're warm, dependable, and emotionally available â€” until you're overwhelmed. You love with all of you, but you need people who don't just *take*. You want connection that feels mutual â€” not performative.

  fullNarrative: `
You are a love letter in motion â€” poetic, playful, and full of emotional color. You move with lightness, speak with heart, and hold a depth behind your charm that very few truly recognize. You're the girl who makes people feel seen, special, and safe â€” all while keeping just enough of yourself tucked away.

You love with optimism and presence. You care with intention. You offer emotional comfort without needing to be asked. But behind your giving nature is someone who notices *everything* â€” and quietly builds her boundaries when she's not being met with the same tenderness she offers.

In love, you're romantic, expressive, and naturally affectionate. You want warmth, attention, and someone who actually *listens*. You crave partnership that feels both exciting and grounded â€” fun but safe, spontaneous but consistent. You'll give everything to someone who protects your softness and respects your independence.

But when hurt, you don't explode â€” you overextend. You give more. You try harder. And when that doesn't work? You vanish emotionally, often with a smile still on your face. Not because you're weak â€” but because you know when you're no longer being loved the way you deserve.

In work and creativity, you're expressive, collaborative, and emotionally intelligent. You shine when you're trusted to lead with heart and creativity. You may not chase status, but you *do* crave meaning. You need to feel your work matters â€” to someone, to something.

In family and friendship, you're the nurturer. The gentle one who holds space, remembers birthdays, soothes emotions, and reads the room before anyone else knows it's shifted. But when your emotional efforts go unreciprocated? You grow distant â€” without warning, but always with a reason.
