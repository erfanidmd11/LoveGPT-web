  fullNarrative: `
You are clarity in motion â€” articulate, sharp, and effortlessly composed. You don't just *speak* â€” you command. There's a natural polish to how you present yourself, and you take pride in being put together â€” emotionally, intellectually, and aesthetically.

You are both head and edge. You think fast, process thoroughly, and speak only what needs to be said. You expect excellence â€” from yourself, from your work, and especially from those closest to you. You don't believe in sloppiness â€” not in communication, not in commitment.

In love, you're thoughtful, consistent, and fiercely loyal â€” once someone proves they're worth the effort. You won't fall for chaos or emotional immaturity. You want partnership that makes sense, grows strong, and *looks good doing it*. You're romantic in a subtle way â€” your affection shows up in protection, attention to detail, and high standards.

But your vulnerability? That's buried under logic. You'd rather fix a problem than sit in the emotion of it. You might criticize instead of comfort. But deep down, you want connection â€” real, respectful, and emotionally mature. You just don't always know how to *ask* for it.

In work, you're a perfectionist with a vision. You lead with clarity, precision, and performance. You set the bar high and *actually clear it*. You're drawn to roles where leadership, visibility, or structure matter â€” and you excel when expectations are clear.

In family and friendships, you show up when it matters â€” and you keep receipts. You notice what others don't, and you don't give your energy away to just anyone. If people meet your standards, they get the best of you. If they don't? You won't fake it.

  fullNarrative: `
You are clarity with curves â€” composed, quick, and unbothered by anyone who can't keep up. You don't just think fast â€” you *speak* fast, *move* fast, and *decide* fast. But what people often miss is that you're not impulsive â€” you're *intentional*. Every word, every look, every silence is calculated.

You lead with intellect and grace. You walk into a room already knowing how you'll leave it. You don't fake confidence â€” you embody it. You're assertive, stylish, and fiercely aware of your environment. But behind that polish? A woman who deeply wants connection â€” just not at the expense of her self-respect.

In love, you're loyal, discerning, and subtly romantic â€” but also high standard. You want affection, yes â€” but even more, you want *alignment*. You test people through conversation, through consistency, and through how well they hold your energy without trying to tame it. If someone passes? They get everything. If not? You'll move on gracefully â€” and *quickly*.

You don't do emotional chaos. You do clarity. If something feels off, you'll ask once. Maybe twice. Then you'll *recalibrate*. You expect loyalty and presence â€” but you rarely ask. You assume people who care will pay attention. If they don't? You never make the same mistake twice.

Professionally, you're a powerhouse. Organized, articulate, strategic. You excel where communication meets control, and where aesthetics matter just as much as efficiency. You lead by example. You don't ask for respect â€” you command it.

In family and friendship, you're loyal, protective, and incredibly helpful â€” as long as you're respected. You're generous with advice and fierce about those you love. But if someone crosses your boundary? They'll feel the shift long before you say a word.
