You are lightning with a laugh â€” loud, clever, and always in motion. You have the fire to lead, the charm to disarm, and the brain to make it look effortless. You're magnetic because you *don't try to be*. You simply are.

People follow your lead â€” in conversation, in vision, in chaos. You're naturally persuasive, deeply expressive, and too intelligent to play small. But stillness? Stillness feels like suffocation. You need freedom, challenge, and novelty like air. And if you feel confined, even by something beautiful â€” you'll disappear, fast.

In love, you're intense, passionate, and playful. You connect fast. You chase hard. But intimacy scares you when it gets too quiet. You flirt like it's instinct, test without warning, and want to be deeply seen â€” while pretending you're just here for fun.

But beneath that charisma is a surprisingly sensitive heart. You care. You just protect it behind humor, distraction, and a dozen exit strategies. You don't want someone to fix you â€” you want someone who can *run beside you* and call you back when you spiral.

In work, you're electric. You lead with vision, execute fast, and thrive in chaos â€” as long as you believe in what you're building. You hate micromanagement. You loathe routine. But give you space to create, and you'll build something unforgettable.

In family and friendship, you're fiercely loyal â€” but on your terms. You'll fight for your people, defend what's yours, and show up in big, surprising ways. But emotional labor drains you fast â€” especially when you don't feel understood.

  fullNarrative: `
You are the spark before the flame, the laugh in the middle of the storm, and the chaos that somehow feels like home. You don't walk into rooms â€” you *interrupt them*. You speak in color. You love in heat. You live with fire. But behind that show-stopping charm is a mind that calculates, a heart that craves, and a soul that *burns*.

You are passion with purpose. Joy with bite. You light up people's lives â€” and then vanish if they try to dim your shine. You're not difficult â€” you're *deliberate*. You want connection *and* freedom. Fire *and* flow. Someone who can hold your chaos without caging your brilliance.

In love, you're intoxicating. Your attention is a high. Your energy is addictive. You fall hard, move fast, and love loudly. But if things start feeling routine or emotionally stagnant? You'll detach â€” emotionally or physically â€” and rarely explain why. You want a love that evolves, expands, excites. You need someone bold enough to love your storm and steady enough to anchor your softer side.

You may test without warning. Flirt to reassure. Leave to be chased. But deep down, what you really want is to be *understood* â€” not just admired.

In work, you're dynamic, daring, and high impact. You thrive in creative roles, leadership, or anything where you can direct energy with freedom. Structure needs to bend. Deadlines need to be yours. And when you're trusted? You exceed *everyone's* expectations.

In family and close bonds, you're wildly loyal â€” but emotionally demanding. You show up with fire, protection, and presence. But you also need to feel *seen*. When your needs go unmet, you don't always say it â€” but the distance will speak for you.
