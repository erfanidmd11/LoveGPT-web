You are a walking headline â€” commanding, witty, and impossible to ignore. You live at the intersection of charm and domination. You don't just hold a room â€” you *own* it. Not because you're loud, but because you radiate certainty, curiosity, and a fearless hunger for more.

You're the rare kind of man who is both wildly articulate and mysteriously unreadable. You give *just enough* to keep people chasing, and leave a trail of intrigue in every conversation. You're ambitious by nature, agile in thought, and rarely satisfied with staying still.

In love, you're fiery, magnetic, and emotionally complex. You flirt like it's a second language, but offer your full heart only to someone who surprises you â€” intellectually and emotionally. You want admiration *and* challenge. Passion *and* patience. You offer love that moves mountains â€” but only once someone earns the truth beneath your performance.

You're hard to hold down, not because you fear commitment â€” but because you fear losing *yourself* inside it. You test before trusting. You leave before explaining. And yet, deep down, you long for someone who can see through the armor and still stay.

In work and purpose, you're a visionary leader. Bold, driven, and charismatic. You think fast, build big, and push boundaries others avoid. You're drawn to impact, not comfort â€” and thrive where risk, movement, and expression meet.

In friendships and family, you're loyal and generous â€” but inconsistent. You show up with fire when it matters, but you retreat when things feel emotionally sticky. Not out of apathy, but because vulnerability â€” real vulnerability â€” makes you feel like you're not in control.

  fullNarrative: `
You are the woman who doesn't just enter a room â€” you shift the frequency of it. You are charm with teeth, elegance with edge, and brilliance with fire. You don't chase â€” you *command*. You don't explain â€” you *deliver*. You're the storm and the silence after it. The muse, the mirror, the spark.

You lead with mind first, but your heart? It's deeper than anyone expects. You crave connection, but you demand respect. You love with heat and style â€” but if someone dares to underestimate your worth? You exit gracefully, and you *never* return to what once dimmed your light.

In love, you are magnetic, emotionally rich, and fiercely selective. You flirt like it's strategy, love like it's war, and stay only when it feels like evolution. You want a partner who can challenge you intellectually and stand beside you emotionally â€” someone strong enough to admire your light without trying to contain it.

But vulnerability doesn't come easy. You hide depth behind brilliance, emotion behind ambition, and affection behind performance. You long to be understood â€” but rarely give people the full roadmap. And the ones who misread you? They don't last long.

In work, you are unstoppable. A visionary wrapped in influence. You thrive in roles that demand creativity, intellect, and leadership. You don't just follow rules â€” you rewrite them. People follow your ideas because they *feel* you mean it. Because you do.

In friendships and family, you're fiercely loyal â€” but emotionally complex. You give a lot. But you also guard your energy with sharp intuition. If you feel emotionally unbalanced or unseen, you pull away. Not for attention â€” for recalibration.
