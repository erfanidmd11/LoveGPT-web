  fullNarrative: `
You are the man who says little and means everything. A master of reading rooms, controlling tempo, and never revealing your full hand. You're not just smart â€” you're strategic. You know how to keep people engaged without giving them control. Your mystery is not an act â€” it's a boundary.

You speak when it counts. You charm with precision. You make people feel like the only person in the room â€” until you're suddenly *gone*, processing everything in silence. You're attractive not just for what you say â€” but for what you don't.

In love, you're alluring, mentally engaging, and emotionally complex. You connect through conversation, flirtation, and emotional intelligence â€” but vulnerability doesn't come easy. You fall hard, but you fall *quietly*. You want loyalty and passion, but also autonomy and control.

You don't open up easily â€” not because you don't feel deeply, but because you've learned to protect what matters. You test people with subtle distance. You watch. And only when you feel safe do you truly let someone in. But once you do? You love with full presence â€” in your own calm, unshakable way.

In work, you're analytical, creative, and incredibly resourceful. You don't need a lot of oversight. You perform best when trusted with space and left alone to *win quietly*. You're often the one behind the scenes making the decisions that change everything.

In friendship and family, you're loyal â€” but private. You love selectively. You offer protection and support, but you rarely make yourself emotionally dependent. You hold space for others â€” just don't always invite them into yours.

  fullNarrative: `
You are elegance with an edge â€” a woman who speaks softly but says everything. You're seductive without trying, emotionally refined without effort, and deeply discerning in every part of your life. You don't follow energy â€” you *read it*, master it, and move accordingly.

You are a private soul with a public glow. People are drawn to you. They don't know why â€” but they feel it. You hold mystery like a mirror, reflecting back only what you want people to see. You're emotionally complex, intellectually brilliant, and *rarely wrong* about what you sense.

In love, you're magnetic, patient, and fiercely intentional. You don't fall often â€” but when you do, you fall *deeply*. You offer presence, grace, and a kind of loyalty that isn't loud â€” it's woven into everything you do. But if trust is broken, you won't explode â€” you'll exit. Quietly. Entirely.

You want a partner who respects your privacy, challenges your mind, and makes emotional safety feel like a given, not a reward. You test subtly. You feel deeply. But your softness is earned â€” not assumed.

In work, you're a strategist, a problem-solver, and a quiet powerhouse. You prefer roles that give you room to think, lead, and move without chaos. You make things look effortless â€” even when they're not. You're as much about structure as you are about soul.

In family and friendships, you're loyal, selective, and deeply protective. You're generous with your presence, but you won't stay where you feel emotionally misunderstood or energetically drained. If the space isn't sacred, you slip out through the silence.
