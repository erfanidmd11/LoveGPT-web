You are freedom with a pulse â€” quick on your feet, quicker with your words, and always two exits ahead. You're charming because you're real, magnetic because you're *in motion*, and unforgettable because you don't *try* to be.

You crave adventure â€” intellectually, romantically, emotionally. You want to be surprised, excited, inspired. Predictability is your greatest fear. You need space to breathe, dream, pivot â€” and people who get in the way of that? They rarely last long.

In love, you're flirtatious, fun, and disarmingly affectionateâ€¦ until the emotional weight gets too heavy. You want connection â€” but you need freedom. You'll give your heart to someone who feels like movement, not a cage. Your ideal partner doesn't try to contain you â€” they *run beside you*.

You love through moments: shared ideas, laughter, stories told at midnight. You rarely say the words â€” but when you're truly in it, your loyalty is felt in the way you stay *interested*. But when the energy shifts or stagnates? You pull away â€” not out of cruelty, but because you're wired for motion.

In career, you're a visionary with range. You thrive in dynamic roles â€” especially those that allow creativity, communication, and movement. You're a connector, an idea machine, and a born entrepreneur. But routine can drain you â€” you need change, challenge, and space to lead.

In friendships and family, you're loyal in your own way. You might forget birthdays â€” but you'll show up with energy when it matters most. You offer excitement, perspective, and the kind of presence that pulls people out of their fog. But you expect to be *understood* without always explaining.

  fullNarrative: `
You are a burst of fresh air no one can catch. Playful, provocative, and beautifully unbothered by rules that don't serve your soul. You speak with spark. You move with magic. And you love like a wildfire â€” passionate, quick, and impossible to forget.

You're not built for boxes â€” emotional, romantic, or societal. You crave freedom, stimulation, new ideas, new feelings. You want romance *and* space. Conversation *and* silence. Someone who can keep up â€” but never slow you down.

In love, you flirt like it's your native tongue. You draw people in with curiosity and mischief. You're affectionate, adventurous, and unpredictable in all the best ways â€” until someone tries to pin you down. You want a partner, not a prison. You need movement, not monitoring.

But under the rebellion is a real romantic. You want to be seen *and* respected. Held *and* given space. You'll give everything to someone who lets you be your full self â€” wild, soft, brilliant, moody, free.

In work and creativity, you're high-impact and fast-moving. You shine in roles that challenge your mind, spark your heart, and let you lead on your own terms. You hate being micromanaged. You need trust and inspiration, not systems that stifle your rhythm.

In friendships and family, you're the spark â€” the one who shifts the energy, brings the joy, and refuses to stay in dynamics that feel controlling. You show up when it counts, but on *your schedule*. You love hard, but you disappear just as quickly if the space doesn't feel like home.
