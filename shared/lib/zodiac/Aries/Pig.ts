  fullNarrative: `
You are warmth with a warning label. A deeply loyal, grounded man who gives his best with open hands â€” until someone tries to take *too much*. You're kind, affectionate, and emotionally present... until you're not. Because once your limits are crossed? That fuse gets *short*.

You have a natural magnetism that doesn't come from ego â€” it comes from being *real*. You care deeply, love fully, and protect instinctively. You're not flashy, but your strength is undeniable. You value honesty, pleasure, and *peace* â€” and you'll fight like hell to preserve all three.

In love, you're all in. You give without hesitation, provide without keeping score, and show your affection through action, presence, and generosity. You're a sensual partner â€” intuitive, nurturing, and fully engaged when your heart is on the table. But betrayal? That shuts the whole system down.

You're no fool. You can spot manipulation, even if you don't call it out. You're slower to anger than most â€” but when it hits, it *erupts*. You forgive... eventually. But you'll never forget how someone made you feel.

In work, you're solid. Focused. Practical. You value stability but hate stagnation. You're capable of long-term commitment, especially when you believe in what you're building. But emotional stress or disrespect at work? That will quietly drain you until you vanish.

In family or deep friendships, you're the steady one. You'll show up with a meal, a plan, a solution. You don't always say much â€” but you notice everything. You love through loyalty, comfort, and consistency. But when you're underappreciated, it cuts deeper than anyone knows.

  fullNarrative: `
You are the definition of fire with a soft glow. You're nurturing without being naive, sensual without being showy, and emotional without being unstable. You give fully â€” your time, your love, your energy â€” but only to those who pass the *unspoken tests* of trust, loyalty, and depth.

People often mistake your warmth for submission. What they don't realize is that everything you offer is *intentional*. You know your worth, even when you give without keeping score. And once you realize you're being taken for granted? That generosity dries up â€” fast.

In love, you're deeply affectionate, romantic, and emotionally tuned in. You build slowly, but once you commit, you *root*. You want someone who can hold space for your softness without trying to control it. You're tender by choice â€” not by default. You'll fight for your partner, your relationship, your home... until you realize you're fighting alone.

You crave connection that feels grounded â€” shared values, shared goals, shared vulnerability. You can handle conflict, but dishonesty? That's a dealbreaker. And once trust is broken, you may never say a word â€” but emotionally, you've already left the building.

In work and purpose, you're committed and consistent. You're not chasing status â€” you're building stability. You want work that means something, helps others, or gives you freedom to live on your own terms. You'll sacrifice short-term comfort for long-term peace â€” but never your integrity.

In family or friendship, you're the heart. The quiet counselor. The one who brings soup, wisdom, and blunt advice when needed. You offer safe spaces â€” but not to everyone. You love fully. And you remember who showed up... and who didn't.
