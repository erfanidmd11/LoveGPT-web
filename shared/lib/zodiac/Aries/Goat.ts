  fullNarrative: `
You are fire wrapped in softness â€” a rare mix of quiet depth and unshakable will. You look easygoing. You feel approachable. But beneath that gentleness lives a man who doesn't bend unless it's *his* choice.

You're a paradox: driven but dreamy, warm but hard to reach, affectionate but fiercely independent. You lead with compassion â€” but you won't be told what to do. You'll smile through discomfort, nod through chaos, and then disappear if someone crosses your boundaries. You don't explode â€” you *evaporate*.

In love, you're poetic. Deeply romantic. Emotionally attuned. You love slowly and seriously â€” but only once trust is earned. You're the type to write love letters no one reads, hold space without speaking, and remember details others forget. You love with artistry. But if you feel emotionally dismissed? You shut down.

You're stubborn â€” but in a quiet, graceful way. You won't fight in public. You won't throw dramatic ultimatums. But you will withdraw, process, and make permanent decisions in silence. You're slow to open, slower to forgive â€” but when you love, it's with full presence and fierce loyalty.

Professionally, you're more creator than commander. You bring vision, emotion, and a strong sense of purpose to your work â€” but you struggle in rigid systems. You're not a fan of micromanagement or meaningless rules. You shine when you're trusted. And when you're not? You shrink or quit â€” even if no one sees it coming.

In family, you're the empath. The calm in the storm. You may not always show up loud, but you show up *real*. You may carry more emotional weight than anyone realizes â€” and that makes you both powerful and exhausted.

  fullNarrative: `
You are elegance with edges. A woman who moves through the world like a poem wrapped in velvet armor. People see your softness â€” and miss the steel beneath it. But you don't need to shout to be heard. You don't need to push to get your way. You lead with feeling â€” and when you move, the right ones follow.

You're deeply creative, endlessly romantic, and quietly intense. Your emotions are oceanic â€” not for public display, but ever-present beneath your surface. You fall in love with people's minds, stories, and subtleties. You don't fall fast, but you fall *real*. And when you do? You love fully, privately, and without apology.

You want connection â€” but only when it feels authentic. You'll walk away from half-hearted affection, even if it hurts. You need depth. Emotional safety. Someone who understands your contradictions: you crave closeness, but demand space; you want to be held, but not owned.

In love, you are nurturing and emotionally wise, but also deeply protective of your freedom. If someone tries to control you, they'll discover just how fast you can vanish. You don't do drama, but you *do* disappear when your heart starts to close. And once it's closed, reopening it isn't easy.

At work, you're quietly brilliant. You don't need to be in charge, but you do need your ideas to be respected. You're intuitive, inventive, and naturally creative. You'll thrive in spaces that let you flow, not conform â€” where your gifts are valued and your spirit isn't boxed in.

In family or deep friendships, you love with ritual and grace. You remember details. You create warmth. But if you're giving more than you're receiving, you'll shrink into silence â€” until someone notices, or until you quietly leave.
