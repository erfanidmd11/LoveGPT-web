  fullNarrative: `
You are the flame that dances, not burns. The man who can light up a room, flip the tension, and win any argument â€” even when you're wrong. You don't take life too seriously... until something *really* matters. And when it does? You show up with surprising depth â€” but only after your curiosity's been captured.

You're the disruptor. The wildcard. The clever tactician who turns chaos into advantage. You're rarely still â€” mentally or physically. You think fast, move faster, and charm like it's your job. But underneath the humor, the showmanship, the rebellion â€” there's a man who *feels deeply* but shows it selectively.

In love, you're a handful â€” and you know it. You flirt like it's an art form, test like it's strategy, and commit only when you know someone won't try to *own* you. You need freedom, laughter, and someone smart enough to keep you on your toes. You'll play games â€” not to hurt, but to *know*. Because once you feel safe, you drop the actâ€¦ and what's underneath is *rare*.

You resist vulnerability, even as you crave closeness. You often make light of things that actually cut deep. You'll ghost when emotions get too heavy â€” not because you're cold, but because you're overwhelmed. But if someone sees through the performance and still stays? You give loyalty that lasts.

Career-wise, you're a creative force. You're wired for innovation, problem-solving, and flipping stale systems upside down. You're a master of influence â€” but you hate boredom and routine. You thrive where there's stimulation, challenge, and space to think freely. Just don't ask you to do the same thing twice.

In family or close bonds, you're the comic relief, the chaos, the protector. You're fiercely loyal â€” but on *your terms*. You struggle with emotional messiness, but you'll show up in your own way: a fix, a joke, a favor, a fight if needed.

  fullNarrative: `
You are chaos in couture â€” witty, radiant, and impossible to ignore. You don't follow rules; you *mock* them. You don't chase â€” you *dare*. You're a vision of contradictions: emotionally unpredictable yet devastatingly wise, impulsive yet calculating, wildly flirty yet spiritually discerning.

You move through life like a whirlwind: charming, untamed, slightly overwhelming â€” and you like it that way. You stir things up. You don't fit neatly in any box, and anyone who tries to hold you too tightly gets a lesson in liberation.

In love, you're unpredictable. One day you're obsessed, the next day you'reâ€¦ somewhere else. You crave romance, attention, worship â€” but also distance, space, *freedom*. You flirt like it's breathing. You love with flair. And you vanish when someone tries to tame you.

You test people â€” not out of malice, but because you *need to know*. Will they fight for you? Will they still choose you when you're not "on"? Will they see beneath the games to the girl who *actually wants to be understood*?

Under the surface, you are vulnerable â€” deeply so. But you've learned that charm is easier than confrontation, laughter is safer than truth, and control feels more reliable than intimacy. You want connection, but you want it on your terms.

In work, you're dazzling. Creative, fast, and full of ideas others are too afraid to try. You challenge authority. You question systems. You blow up routines that feel too safe. You're at your best when no one tells you how to win â€” you just *do*.

In family, you're loyal, hilarious, and exhausting in the best way. You love your people â€” but don't ask you to be predictable. You express affection through chaos, brilliance, and last-minute acts of love.
