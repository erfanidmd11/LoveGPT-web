  fullNarrative: `
You are lightning in a leather jacket â€” intensity, speed, fire, and charm, all wrapped in raw masculinity. When you enter a space, people feel it before they see it. You don't try to take over the room â€” you *are* the room. Bold, animated, electric. And yetâ€¦ behind all of that fire lives someone who wants to be understood more than admired.

You're charming, beautiful in movement and presence, and people are naturally pulled into your orbit. But building something lasting with you? That's a challenge. You hate control, can't stand emotional pressure, and won't tolerate forced closeness. Your independence is non-negotiable â€” but that doesn't mean you're indifferent. You crave connection, just on your own terms.

In love, you're magnetic and loyal â€” until the novelty wears off or the freedom feels threatened. You thrive in romantic intensity, but marriage or long-term structure may take years to fully embrace. You give everything in passion, and yet can ghost just as fast if you feel boxed in. And in intimacy? You burn with intensity â€” dominant, bold, unforgettable. But emotional depth? That takes trust, patience, and someone who knows how to *handle your fire without dousing it*.

You lead naturally, even when you don't try. You're brilliant in crisis, persuasive in meetings, magnetic in front of a crowd. But structure bores you. Repetition makes you itch. You're a creator, a challenger, a disruptor. You need projects with risk and people with range. A life without passion? Not an option.

But here's the truth: as much as you rebel against it, you crave peace. Real peace. You want to be able to come home to someone who doesn't just admire the spark â€” but knows how to hold the man behind it.

  fullNarrative: `
You don't walk into rooms â€” you *invade* them with light, energy, and something no one can quite put their finger on. You are the flame, the movement, the moment. Charismatic doesn't quite cover it. You spark revolutions with your presence, and yetâ€¦ you often forget to fight for yourself the way you fight for the world.

You're a born decision-maker â€” for *everyone else*. You can lead a team into fire, inspire a movement, or manifest an idea out of air. But when it's time to make a personal decision? You pause. Not out of fear â€” but because your life is so big, your vision so sweeping, that commitment often feels like a trap.

Your life is often a series of reinventions. You move, pivot, leap. New jobs. New passions. New cities. You crave the thrill of possibility â€” but without anchors, you sometimes drift into loneliness or financial chaos. You are more than capable of building empires â€” but only if you learn to build *within* before running toward the next horizon.

In love, you want it all â€” worship, power, loyalty, electricity. You give intensely but often with an agenda: to be seen, admired, cherished. Devotion isn't natural â€” it's earned. You may leave relationships quickly, without guilt, because when the energy shifts, so do you. But beneath it? A deeper hunger to be loved for the you that's *never* loud.

As a partner, you're unpredictable but passionate. You're not one to beg â€” your pride would never allow it. But if you *choose* someone? That choice is sacred. You're generous, protective, and full of affection â€” until your ego feels dismissed. Then the fire turns cold.

In family, you grow into love. Maturity teaches you the beauty of roots, and eventually, you become a ferocious mother and devoted partner. But you're still learning how to receive love without performance. You overgive. You over-fight. You protect to the point of exhaustion. And when you don't feel recognized for it â€” despair follows.

Career is your arena. You're a builder, a speaker, a shapeshifter. You don't just want success â€” you want to *move* people. You're rarely broke for long â€” your talents print money. But managing money? That's a curve. And constant change makes financial grounding difficult unless you choose stability *on purpose*.
