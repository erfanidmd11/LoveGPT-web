  fullNarrative: `
You are loyalty personified â€” not in words, but in action. You're the kind of man people trust without knowing why. You move with conviction, speak with intention, and fight for what you love with zero hesitation. But make no mistake â€” you're not soft. You're *selective*. You're not trying to be liked â€” you're trying to be *real*.

You're principled, grounded, and direct. You believe in honesty, loyalty, and living with purpose. You hate games, detest manipulation, and don't have time for people who aren't *all in*. You're not flashy â€” but you *are* unforgettable. Because your energy is consistent. Clear. Unshakable.

In love, you're steady and protective. You're slow to trust, but once you do? You become a fortress â€” supportive, emotionally invested, quietly intense. You may not say much about your feelings, but you'll show them. In your presence. Your actions. Your sacrifices.

You don't fall for flings â€” you fall for *substance*. You need a partner who respects your integrity, matches your emotional depth, and doesn't flinch when things get real. You're a romantic in disguise â€” you just guard your heart like it's under lock and key.

In career and life, you're a dependable powerhouse. You work hard, you lead without ego, and you protect the people under your wing. You don't chase attention â€” you chase *impact*. You thrive when you believe in the mission. But when things feel dishonest or disloyal? You're out.

In family and friendships, you're the protector. You'll hold the line when no one else does. You're not the loudest, but you're often the most solid. People lean on you â€” sometimes too much â€” and you rarely complain, even when you should.

  fullNarrative: `
You are a woman of loyalty, fire, and depth â€” a rare breed who speaks the truth, shows up fully, and doesn't blink in the face of chaos. You are grounded in integrity, guided by instinct, and powered by purpose. You don't need attention to feel powerful â€” you already *are*.

You lead with heart â€” but only when it's earned. You don't fall easily, and you don't pretend. When you care, it's visceral. When you love, it's all-consuming. But if someone breaks your trust? That door locks. Not out of cruelty â€” but out of sacred self-protection.

You don't give yourself away casually. You're reserved with your softness, precise with your presence. You test people with silence, with observation, with the wait. Because once someone is inside your circle? You'll fight for them with everything you have. Just don't mistake your calm for passivity â€” when pushed, you *bite*.

In love, you're loyal to the core. You want honesty, emotional clarity, and a partner who doesn't get intimidated by your independence. You don't care for games or surface charm â€” you want real. You love deeply, but you expect emotional maturity in return. You will give your best, but you won't settle for less.

At work, you're the backbone. Focused, ethical, and committed. You bring value in ways most don't even see â€” in how you hold things together, how you protect what matters, and how you silently get it *done*. You thrive in roles where loyalty, structure, and passion collide.

In family and friendships, you're protective, dependable, and emotionally wise. You love through action â€” not performance. You're the quiet fixer, the patient guide, the one who'll show up when it really counts. But you rarely ask for the same. And sometimes, that costs you more than you show.
