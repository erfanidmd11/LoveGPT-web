  fullNarrative: `
You are a paradox wrapped in silk and smarts â€” soft in your tone, but razor-sharp in your soul. People may underestimate you based on your grace, your smile, your quiet composure. Let them. Because while they're distracted by your charm, you're already two steps ahead, reading the room, making your move, and calculating your escape plan if needed.

You're not aggressive â€” you're *strategic*. You don't need to raise your voice to command. You use your intuition like a compass, your beauty like a shield, and your independence like a fortress.

You are emotionally intelligent but don't give your vulnerability away for free. In fact, you often mask your passion behind playfulness. But make no mistake: when you love, it's full-body, full-soul, and non-negotiable. You need depth, safety, and adoration â€” but you're rarely the one to ask for it.

In love, you're intense without being obvious. You charm with subtlety, test with grace, and stay only where there is *presence*, not pressure. You dream of partnership â€” but you refuse to trade your freedom or your complexity for anyone's comfort.

At work, you're more visionary than task-robot. You work best in environments where your creativity is seen and your emotional radar is trusted. You prefer harmony over hierarchy, but you'll lead with quiet confidence when the moment demands it.

In family, you're nurturing and fiercely protective. You keep emotional tabs on everyone, often at your own expense. But if you feel overlooked or unappreciated? That smile disappears fast. You give so much â€” but expect to be seen for it. And if you're not? You'll vanish emotionally before anyone realizes what they've lost.

  fullNarrative: `
You are the slow-burn version of boldness â€” all the fire of a fighter, wrapped in the grace of a diplomat. You don't explode â€” you *ignite*. Quietly. Intentionally. And always with a deeper reason than anyone expects.

On the surface, you're collected, even soft-spoken. But underneath? You're a strategist. A creator. A man with fierce internal standards and a will of steel. You're the kind of man who gets overlooked by people too focused on volume â€” until you outlast and outshine them all.

You don't fight for attention â€” you fight for *meaning*. You're selective with your time, your energy, and especially your love. You're romantic, but rarely reckless. You'll give everything â€” once you feel emotionally safe. But getting there? That's a path most people never even see.

In love, you crave connection, but you don't chase it. You want someone who understands nuance. Someone who feels like peace, not pressure. You're affectionate, thoughtful, and fiercely loyal â€” once you believe the other person truly *sees* you. You've been burned before â€” you're cautious now.

At work, you're creative, strategic, and quietly competitive. You might not be loud, but you always know what's going on. You prefer environments where you can work independently, create impact, and not be micromanaged. You dislike confrontation â€” but when cornered, you fight with precision and clarity.

In relationships and family life, you're deeply supportive â€” but you require space. You're the type to listen more than you speak, remember small things others miss, and take on burdens no one even knows you're carrying. But when emotionally overloaded? You retreat. You process alone. And if someone tries to force their way in, they'll meet walls they didn't know existed.
