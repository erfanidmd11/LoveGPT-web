  fullNarrative: `
You are what happens when willpower marries wisdom â€” a man who leads not with noise, but with gravity. Your presence alone says "I've got this." And most of the time? You do.

There's a fire in you, no doubt â€” but it's not for show. You burn slow, deep, and purposeful. You don't rush into things â€” you *survey, plan, and execute.* And when you commit to something (or someone), it's for real. Your loyalty is legendary. Your standards? Even higher.

You don't just handle pressure â€” you are pressure. A builder. A protector. A strategist who never needs to raise his voice to command a room. But all that strength can sometimes wall off what matters most: softness, surrender, connection. You don't like being vulnerable â€” even to those who've earned your trust.

When it comes to love, you're not a romantic in the traditional sense â€” but your devotion is no less profound. You'll build a life with someone you believe in. You'll show up through fire, failure, and chaos. But you struggle to share your inner world. It's not coldness â€” it's conditioning. You've learned to survive by holding it in, not letting it flow.

In family, you're often seen as the rock â€” steady, providing, unshakable. And yet, behind closed doors, you long for more softness. You feel deeply, but rarely say it out loud. You work long hours and take pride in providing â€” but connection isn't just about showing up with solutions. Sometimes, it's just about being *present*.

You're a grinder. A long-game operator. You rise steadily, refusing shortcuts, ignoring trends, focusing on stability and legacy. Titles don't excite you â€” *impact* does. You're at your best when you're in charge of something real, something that matters.

But here's the thing: you can overdo it. You can set standards so high they choke your joy. You can carry everything until your back breaks â€” and still not ask for help. You wear responsibility like armor. But even steel needs rest.

You are a paradox in heels: controlled chaos, steady ambition, and hidden tenderness under layers of executive energy. You radiate strength â€” not because you're trying to, but because you simply *are*.

People feel your energy before you say a word. You don't ask for attention â€” it's simply pulled to you. You're driven, bold, and endlessly curious. But in your earlier years, that same energy often took detours â€” impulsivity masked as passion, intensity mistaken for power. You've made mistakes, but they were lessons in high definition.

You crave both freedom and structure, independence and intimacy. You're not looking for just any partner â€” you're looking for a *witness* to your greatness. Someone emotionally mature, steady, and unafraid of your fire. Love in your youth was often misunderstood or mismanaged â€” but over time, you've mastered not just attraction, but *alignment*.

You don't follow â€” you forge. You don't blend in â€” you redefine. Whether in your career, your relationships, or your personal growth, you set high bars. Maybe too high. Sometimes you chase goals that exhaust you more than they elevate you. But you keep going. Because you're not just building a life â€” you're building a *legacy*.

In family, you are fiercely loyal, protective, and proud. But emotional labor burns you fast. You expect maturity from others. You don't do small talk or surface-level care. You're not always expressive â€” but your presence is your love language.

In the workplace, you're surgical. Methodical. Unshakably focused when aligned. You don't just want income â€” you want impact. But here's the warning: your ambition doesn't need to bulldoze your rest. You don't need to prove anything anymore. You've already become the woman you once dreamed of being.
