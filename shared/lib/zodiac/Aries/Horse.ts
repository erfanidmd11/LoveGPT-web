  fullNarrative: `
You are the embodiment of motion â€” a man wired for speed, passion, and possibility. You don't walk through life. You *gallop*. You're bold, curious, and impossible to pin down. People don't follow you because they understand your path â€” they follow because you make *freedom* look like a lifestyle.

You're naturally charismatic. You speak, and people listen. You laugh, and people fall in love. You move, and people feel inspired. But beneath the confidence and charm, there's a truth: you're not just chasing the next thrill â€” you're chasing meaning. The fire in you wants more than applause â€” it wants *impact*.

In love, you're passionate, attentive, and wildly exciting â€” for a time. But routine dulls you. Emotional heaviness repels you. You want connection, but not if it feels like a cage. You need a partner who is both grounded and untamed â€” someone who understands your independence isn't a rejection, it's a rhythm.

You give your best when you feel free â€” not controlled. But the truth? Freedom without roots leads to burnout. You may run from intimacy when it gets too quiet. You may leave good people because they didn't challenge you enough. And you may confuse adrenaline for love â€” but you're here to learn the difference.

At work, you're dynamic and driven. You need purpose, variety, and space to create on your terms. You don't thrive in bureaucracies. You're a builder, a founder, a spark. But you can get bored easily, abandoning projects just before they bloom. Learn to stay. That's where legacy lives.

In family or deep relationships, you're fiercely loyal when you feel respected. You won't do emotional micromanagement â€” but you will protect your own with energy and fire. You're not great with rules â€” but you're incredible with people.

  fullNarrative: `
You were not born to follow. You were born to run â€” wild-hearted, bold, radiant, and deeply felt. You're magnetic in motion and impossible to forget. You bring light, joy, and fire to the lives you enter â€” but you're not here to *stay in one place* for anyone.

You're the woman who laughs loud, loves hard, and disappears when things feel stagnant. You crave novelty. You don't fear risk. You chase experiences that expand you, and people who challenge you â€” emotionally, mentally, spiritually.

In love, you're a rollercoaster: thrilling, intense, wildly affectionateâ€¦ and unpredictable. You fall fast and deep, but your affection comes with one condition â€” never try to own her. You want to be chosen *every day*, not possessed. You desire partnership, but only with someone who can match your momentum *and* respect your space.

You may leave before you're left. Not because you're cold â€” but because you've been burned. You're not afraid of love â€” you're afraid of being caged by it. When you feel safe, you become intoxicatingly loyal, deeply nurturing, and fiercely protective. But get too comfortable? You'll feel the itch to run.

Career is your playground. You bring flair, spark, and spontaneous brilliance. You don't just want a job â€” you want a *mission*. You thrive in motion, with variety, freedom, and a dash of chaos. You inspire others with your energy, but burnout can hit fast if you never pause long enough to *receive*.

In family or close bonds, you're the fun one, the firestarter, the protector. You're the one who keeps things *alive*. But your energy can be hard to match. And your need for freedom can leave others confused â€” or behind. You want deep connection, but not at the cost of your fire.
