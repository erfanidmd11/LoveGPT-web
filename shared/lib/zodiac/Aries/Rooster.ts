  fullNarrative: `
You are the thunderclap that shows up *on time*. The man who doesn't just move through life â€” he *commands it*. You're sharp, structured, and impossible to ignore. When you speak, it's direct. When you work, it's relentless. You hold yourself â€” and everyone around you â€” to high, often impossible standards.

Your energy is intense and unapologetic. You're ambitious by nature and competitive by instinct. You don't *try* to lead â€” you assume leadership like gravity. You value order, performance, and results. Weak excuses and emotional flailing? You'll walk.

But beneath the control, there's fire. A deeper passion. And a vulnerability you rarely show. You mask insecurity with certainty, tenderness with tasks. You're loyal as hell â€” but don't confuse that with softness. You'll fight for your people, just don't ask you to *coddle* them.

In love, you're protective and focused. You show affection through effort â€” showing up, handling problems, building futures. But you struggle with emotional openness. You want connection, but you expect your partner to "get it" without having to explain. And when you feel misunderstood? You withdraw â€” or react. Loudly.

Romantically, you value admiration. You want a partner who respects your drive, mirrors your work ethic, and doesn't unravel when challenged. You're not looking for codependence â€” you're looking for someone strong enough to stand beside you without needing to *win* every time.

Professionally, you're an architect of ambition. You build structures, systems, and success â€” often from scratch. You're great in charge, but not always graceful with change. You like routine, respect tradition, and improve what you inherit. But don't mistake routine for laziness â€” you never stop refining, upgrading, *perfecting*.

In family and close friendships, you're the provider, the enforcer, the example. You love hard â€” but conditionally. When people earn your loyalty, you become their fortress. But if they slip too many times? Your forgiveness has a limit.

  fullNarrative: `
You are elegance with a sharp edge â€” polished, prepared, and five steps ahead of the chaos you refuse to participate in. You don't just enter a room. You *arrive*. People notice your posture, your presence, your precision. You don't try to impress â€” you *set the standard*.

You're structured, ambitious, and high-functioning â€” sometimes to your own detriment. You don't just do things â€” you *do them well*. You hold yourself to standards others wouldn't dare apply. You run on discipline, drive, and the deep belief that if you don't do it, it might not get done right.

But under the armor of control lives a romantic soul who wants to *feel* as much as she executes. The catch? You rarely show it. You want love, deep love â€” but only if it respects your independence and matches your energy. You give everything once you're in â€” but getting in? That's a gated process.

In relationships, you're loyal, devoted, and protective â€” but you expect the same. No shortcuts. No games. You're direct with your expectations and brutal with your self-awareness. You'll forgive â€” once. You'll love â€” fully. But if someone mistakes your grace for weakness, they'll see how fast a queen can turn cold.

In love, you crave admiration *and* accountability. You don't want a caretaker â€” you want a co-strategist. Someone who can hold emotional space *and* plan logistics. A partner who sees your softness *without you having to perform it*.

In your career, you're unshakable. People come to you when things fall apart â€” and you rebuild with excellence. You don't crack under pressure. You *organize it*. You are the solution when others are still in shock. You shine in structure and take pride in your precision.

Family and close friends may see a slightly gentler version of you, but even then â€” you're the reliable one, the rock, the unspoken leader. You carry more than anyone realizes. You give more than most deserve. And if no one says thank you? You'll file it away â€” and keep going.
