  fullNarrative: `
You are power with a password. People feel your confidence before you ever speak it. You're not loud â€” you're *loaded*. With vision. With strategy. With depth. You don't just act â€” you *plan*. Every move, every glance, every step feels intentional. Because it is.

You combine ambition with restraint â€” a rare and potent mix. You're the man who gets things done while everyone else is still talking about it. You don't need to dominate the room with volume. You do it with presence. And that presence? Magnetic.

In love, you're not flashy. You're *seductive*. You don't chase â€” you *draw in*. You listen well, speak rarely, and watch everything. When you love, it's with a hypnotic focus, a consuming loyalty, and a fierce protectiveness. But emotional transparency? That's the edge. You want connection â€” but on your terms.

You tend to hide the parts of you that are vulnerable. You're a private thinker with a public fire. You crave depth, but don't always know how to let someone *into* yours. You've likely been misunderstood â€” maybe even underestimated â€” by those who mistook your stillness for softness. But the ones who get you? Know you're a force.

In career, you're a tactical leader. You thrive in environments where intelligence meets power. You can build empires from blueprints no one else understands. You don't work for the spotlight â€” but you'll take the top position if it gets you closer to the vision. You're cool under pressure and relentless about success. Quietly. Elegantly. Ruthlessly â€” when required.

In family or close relationships, you're protective, composed, and thoughtful. But you keep your emotional cards close. You need space. You don't like being pushed. And when overwhelmed? You'll retreat into silence. Not to punish â€” but to *process*.

You are mystery in motion â€” a woman who turns heads without trying and holds power in silence. You're the definition of controlled fire. Composed. Magnetic. Private. A study in contrast: you want depth, yet reveal little. You seek connection, yet crave solitude. And somehow, you *pull it off* â€” beautifully.

You don't yell to be heard. You don't chase to be loved. You attract by *being*. You exude elegance, wit, and a touch of danger â€” just enough to intrigue, but never enough to be predictable. You hold your emotions close, not because you lack depth, but because you've learned that not everyone is worthy of your unfiltered truth.

In love, you move with caution. You want passion â€” but without chaos. You need loyalty â€” but not dependency. You're sensual, emotional, and intense â€” but never sloppy. You play the long game, waiting until someone earns your soft. And when they do? You love with layered loyalty, emotional precision, and fierce emotional fidelity. But if they betray it â€” they're erased.

You're often misunderstood â€” seen as too independent, too polished, too unreadable. But what people miss is that your calm is *protection*, not distance. Your reserve isn't coldness â€” it's power.

Professionally, you're strategic and sharp. You don't just climb ladders â€” you design them. You navigate male-dominated spaces with grace, speak only when needed, and let results speak louder than your rÃ©sumÃ©. You might not need the spotlight â€” but it finds you anyway. Especially when you walk into a room like you already own the outcome.

In family and friendship, you're discerning. You keep a small circle â€” and that circle is sacred. You love quietly, protect fiercely, and forgive slowly. You don't tolerate chaos in your close quarters. When it comes to emotional energy? You are both the filter and the boundary.
