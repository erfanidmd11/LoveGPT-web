  fullNarrative: `
You are fire with a mission â€” structured, focused, and emotionally intense in a way that surprises people. You're driven by purpose, fueled by passion, and grounded by values you don't compromise. You don't just want love â€” you want alignment.

In love, you're fiercely loyal, emotionally present, and surprisingly romantic in your own structured rhythm. You may not always say it first, but you *show it* â€” through consistency, protection, and your ability to stand firm in the moments others pull away.

You give your heart intentionally. You're not here for shallow distractions or emotionally inconsistent energy. You want a partner who respects your pace, understands your fire, and knows how to support your drive without dimming your direction.

If your loyalty is taken for granted or your integrity challenged, you don't lash out. You pull back â€” fully. Quietly. With a finality that doesn't ask for closure because it *is* closure.

In work, you're ambitious, strategic, and high-performing. You thrive in spaces where execution matters as much as vision. You're a leader through action, not just words â€” and your presence often demands results without needing to demand respect.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, protective, and steady. You give deeply and expect honesty in return. If someone violates your trust? You don't forget â€” and you rarely re-offer what was once unconditional.

  fullNarrative: `
You are structure with a spark â€” emotionally intelligent, passionate, fiercely loyal, and grounded in truth that doesn't waver under pressure. You don't just *believe* in love â€” you believe in love that honors your values, your independence, and your fire.

In love, you are bold, deeply devoted, and surprisingly vulnerable once someone proves they can meet you in truth. You give fully, but not recklessly. You want a partner who's consistent, clear, and courageous enough to love a woman who doesn't *need* them â€” but *chooses* them every single day.

You love through action. Through loyalty. Through showing up and staying when it matters. But if you feel controlled, betrayed, or emotionally dismissed? You don't beg. You *leave*. Proudly. Silently. With your peace intact and your dignity doubled.

You're passionate, but you're also pragmatic. You don't chase fantasy â€” you build reality. But that reality must have meaning, movement, and *mutual respect*.

In work, you're organized, powerful, and mission-driven. You lead with focus and expect excellence. You don't cut corners, and you don't play small. Your standards elevate everyone around you â€” but you're never arrogant about it.

In friendship and family, you're loyal, protective, and principled. You give love with precision â€” and expect it to be returned with the same level of intention. If it's not? You set boundaries so clean, no one questions them.
