  fullNarrative: `
You are warmth with direction â€” a blend of fire and feeling, of big-picture vision and soul-level intuition. You dream boldly and love gently. You crave a life that means something, and a love that feels like both a mirror and a safe haven.

In love, you're idealistic, romantic, and emotionally present â€” once you feel respected. You give your loyalty slowly but wholeheartedly. You want someone who understands your rhythm: your need for independence *and* reassurance, your bold spirit *and* your soft heart.

You show love through attentiveness, creative thoughtfulness, and unwavering support. But if your care is dismissed or your depth misunderstood, you drift â€” not because you're afraid, but because your energy isn't disposable.

You want a partner who brings peace, not pressure. Someone who believes in your dreams, holds space for your sensitivity, and respects your need to evolve. You don't want control â€” you want connection that feels like expansion.

In work, you're creative, introspective, and motivated by meaning. You thrive in environments that value emotion, beauty, and authenticity. You don't want to just produce â€” you want to *inspire*. And when your heart is in it, your impact is undeniable.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, nurturing, and deeply intuitive. You notice what others miss, feel things before they're spoken, and show up when it matters â€” not always loudly, but always *fully*.

  fullNarrative: `
You are softness that moves â€” graceful, emotionally rich, wildly independent, and deeply loyal to the path and people that honor your rhythm. You don't need loud love â€” you need *safe love*. Love that grows with you, not around you. Love that respects both your silence and your spark.

In love, you're thoughtful, nurturing, and fiercely loyal once trust is established. You give with quiet generosity â€” not for validation, but because your heart knows how to love *fully*. You offer presence, creativity, and emotional understanding â€” but only when you feel seen without needing to explain yourself.

You need connection that supports your freedom and values your emotional world. You want someone who listens without fixing, loves without restricting, and builds without rushing. You're romantic in the way you remember things no one else noticed. And when your care is unreturned? You don't explode â€” you *fade*.

At work, you're creative, intuitive, and best in environments where empathy and meaning are valued. You bring soul to structure and art to the everyday. You work hard, but only when your purpose is fed â€” not just your paycheck.

In friendship and family, you're the emotional compass â€” quietly supportive, deeply observant, and slow to open but impossible to forget. You give loyalty, patience, and love without demand â€” but if taken for granted, you detach with grace and finality.
