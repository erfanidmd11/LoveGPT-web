  fullNarrative: `
You are fire with a plan â€” curious, clever, full of movement, and emotionally sharper than people expect. You're not here for surface-level anything. You want passion *and* possibility. You love with adventure and strategy â€” and when you commit, it's because something *clicked* on a soul and mind level.

You flirt with freedom. You chase knowledge. But deep down, you're a builder â€” someone who wants to create something meaningful, not just thrilling. You give love that's present, intelligent, and honest â€” once someone proves they won't clip your wings just to keep you close.

In love, you're romantic in your own rhythm. You show up through action, ideas, invitations, and quick-witted intimacy. You need space to breathe â€” but depth to stay. You want a partner who matches your mind, respects your fire, and doesn't expect you to play small just to be held.

If someone tries to trap you, emotionally manipulate you, or dull your spark, you'll step back â€” with little warning, but total clarity. You don't stay where you're not inspired.

In work, you're innovative, agile, and persuasive. You thrive in fast-paced, idea-rich environments. You lead with instinct, logic, and energy. You see patterns others miss â€” and know how to move pieces into place before the board even shifts.

In friendships and family, you're funny, insightful, and surprisingly protective. You don't love with drama â€” but you do love *deeply*. You just need people who understand that your loyalty doesn't always look traditional â€” but it's rock-solid once earned.

  fullNarrative: `
You are movement wrapped in meaning â€” spontaneous, soulful, and constantly evolving. You don't stay where you can't grow, and you don't love halfway. When you feel it? You *feel it*. Deeply. Loudly. Without apology. But only if it's real.

You flirt with life â€” and with love â€” but not out of carelessness. You're observant. Discerning. Strategic. You test the waters before you dive, but when you do, your loyalty is fierce and your fire is forever.

In love, you're independent, emotionally intelligent, and surprisingly soft beneath the sparkle. You need space *and* intimacy. Passion *and* emotional truth. You'll give your all to someone who respects your rhythm, mirrors your energy, and knows how to walk beside you â€” not behind, not in front, but *with*.

You love best when you're seen *and* allowed to roam. If someone tries to dim your spark or tether your wild, you'll leave with grace â€” but with no intention of returning. You don't chase comfort. You chase connection that *feels like freedom*.

In work, you're sharp, expressive, and fast-moving. You shine in environments that value innovation, people skills, and bold ideas. You don't do well in boxes â€” you need space to stretch your mind and trust your instincts.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, protective, and full of insight. You bring laughter, clarity, and fire to every space you're in â€” but if your care is taken for granted, your presence disappears before anyone realizes you're already gone.
