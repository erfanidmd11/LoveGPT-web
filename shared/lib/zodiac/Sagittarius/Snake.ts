  fullNarrative: `
You are fire with precision â€” emotionally intuitive, intellectually sharp, and grounded in a rhythm few people can match. You don't love quickly â€” you love *intentionally*. You observe before engaging. You listen before trusting. And once you do? You give your loyalty quietly, but completely.

You're magnetic but reserved. Passionate but disciplined. You love through action, integrity, and a presence that makes people feel safe â€” even if they never fully understand you. You don't overshare. You *over-deliver*. And when someone disrespects your peace? You don't argue. You disappear.

In love, you're affectionate, protective, and emotionally strategic. You crave depth â€” but without chaos. Passion â€” but with clarity. You want a connection that challenges your mind and holds your heart without needing to control it. If it feels performative or emotionally messy? You're out.

You love through loyalty, space, and small, sacred acts of presence. You protect your heart with silence until someone proves they can hold it with care.

At work, you're focused, efficient, and remarkably strategic. You thrive where planning meets people â€” where your insight is valued and your independence is respected. You're a leader who doesn't need to talk to be heard.

In friendship and family, you're loyal, protective, and observant. You won't always say how you feel â€” but you'll show up, solve problems, and keep the energy calm. But if your care is misread or ignored, you pull back quickly and quietly.

  fullNarrative: `
You are freedom in silk â€” poised, sharp, and emotionally layered. You move through the world with purpose, grace, and a quiet intensity that speaks louder than words. You don't need attention â€” you need *truth*. You don't chase affection â€” you *attract* what aligns.

You're emotionally intelligent, fiercely self-aware, and naturally discerning. You test before trusting. You observe before opening. And once you choose someone? Your loyalty is sacred, sensual, and quietly unshakable.

In love, you're intentional, magnetic, and selectively vulnerable. You want fire *and* structure. Depth *without drama*. You love with sophistication, but also raw devotion â€” once you feel emotionally safe. If someone crosses your boundary or plays with your time, you don't fight. You *vanish*.

You're not afraid to be alone â€” but when you're in, you're *in fully*. You want a partner who sees behind the poise to the fire beneath â€” and knows how to hold it without needing to control it.

At work, you're strategic, confident, and quietly commanding. You shine in environments that reward discipline, intuition, and trust. You don't need the spotlight â€” but when you speak, people listen.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, composed, and emotionally anchored. You offer insight, protection, and presence â€” but only where your energy is valued. If your love is taken for granted, you detach with dignity, and rarely reopen the door.
