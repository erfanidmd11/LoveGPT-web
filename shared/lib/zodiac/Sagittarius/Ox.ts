  fullNarrative: `
You are fire with a foundation â€” bold, curious, loyal, and grounded in emotional consistency. You move toward growth, truth, and freedom â€” but not with chaos. You plan. You commit. You build. And when you love, it's not just passion â€” it's *purpose*.

You're not here for emotional guesswork or rushed decisions. You want connection that feels aligned, honest, and expansive. You need freedom, but you also crave structure â€” not to be controlled, but to make sure what you're building actually *lasts*.

In love, you're steady, devoted, and intensely loyal once you choose someone. You might not express emotion loudly, but you show it through consistency, presence, and an unwavering sense of care. You're the protector, the planner, the builder â€” and when you're in, you're all in.

But if someone disrespects your time, your loyalty, or your values? You won't make a scene. You'll simply stop showing up â€” and that silence says more than any speech ever could.

In work, you're ambitious, strategic, and hardworking. You thrive in environments that value vision *and* execution. You're not here to coast. You're here to rise â€” and bring people with you who understand that your pace is steady, not slow.

In friendships and family, you're reliable, protective, and quietly present. You support without fanfare. You lead without ego. But if you're overlooked, you withdraw â€” not because you're weak, but because your love is *sacred*, and your presence is a privilege.

  fullNarrative: `
You are passion with a spine â€” confident, emotionally rooted, and deeply loyal to the path and the people who match your standards. You don't just dream â€” you *build*. You don't chase love â€” you *choose* it. Carefully. Purposefully. Powerfully.

In love, you're romantic, driven, and surprisingly tender beneath your fire. You give your loyalty slowly but completely. You need a partner who values your freedom, respects your emotional rhythm, and doesn't confuse your strength for someone who doesn't need care.

You love with consistency, devotion, and a depth that's hidden beneath your ambition. You show up. You commit. You grow. But if your loyalty is taken for granted or your values are compromised? You walk â€” not to prove a point, but to protect your peace.

You want partnership that's rooted and expansive â€” someone who believes in your dreams, supports your discipline, and knows how to love you *without needing to tame you*. You don't do chaos. You don't do manipulation. You do *clarity*, *truth*, and *growth*.

In work, you're focused, driven, and deeply capable. You thrive in environments where passion meets structure â€” where your discipline is a gift and your ideas are respected. You're a leader by example â€” and you never do anything halfway.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, protective, and the one who always follows through. You give love through reliability, insight, and fierce presence. But when your effort isn't appreciated, your emotional doors close â€” quietly, but completely.
