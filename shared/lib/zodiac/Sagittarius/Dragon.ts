  fullNarrative: `
You are purpose with a pulse â€” intense, magnetic, and fearless in your pursuit of truth, freedom, and legacy. You move with conviction, speak with clarity, and love with a depth that is often underestimated beneath your wildness.

You don't love lightly â€” but you do love *loudly*. You want more than affection. You want expansion. A partner who's not afraid of your energy â€” someone who mirrors your passion, respects your independence, and walks beside you without needing to slow your pace.

In love, you're expressive, loyal, and emotionally intense. You commit with your full fire â€” once it feels *real*. You're protective, generous, and fully present â€” but if your passion is met with control or dishonesty, you leave. No guilt. No delay. You know your worth, and you protect your soul like it's a sacred asset.

You love through movement, purpose, and vision. You're romantic, but not fragile. You're affectionate, but not needy. You want a partner who builds with you â€” not someone who simply watches you lead.

In work, you're dynamic, disciplined, and innovative. You thrive in leadership, entrepreneurship, or any arena where big ideas meet fearless action. You're a disruptor with a compass â€” bold enough to burn bridges, but wise enough to know *when*.

In friendships and family, you're fiercely loyal, emotionally honest, and inspiring. You don't keep many people close â€” but those who earn your trust get your full protection and presence.

  fullNarrative: `
You are freedom in heels â€” bold, magnetic, emotionally intense, and utterly unforgettable. You don't ask for love â€” you *command* it. Not through demand, but through presence. You know your worth. You speak your truth. And you don't stay anywhere that dims your fire.

In love, you are fiercely loyal, deeply passionate, and unapologetically honest. You love fully, but only once someone proves they can meet you at your level â€” emotionally, mentally, spiritually. You crave a connection that challenges, expands, and *honors your power*.

You don't fall for soft words. You fall for bold action, emotional maturity, and someone who respects your need for space and vision. If they can hold your wildness while standing strong in their own energy? You'll give them a kind of loyalty that feels both protective and empowering.

But if your fire is stifled or your values are betrayed? You don't argue â€” you *exit*. Completely. Proudly. Quietly â€” but with finality. You know the cost of losing yourself, and you never let love pull you into a place where your truth is silenced.

In work, you're a leader, a builder, a visionary. You thrive in spaces that demand both fire and focus. You inspire others by simply *being yourself*. Your energy isn't just electric â€” it's *anchored*.

In friendships and family, you are fiercely protective, honest, and uplifting. You don't give second chances easily, but you'll stand with the people you love through fire, storm, and silence â€” as long as the loyalty is mutual.
