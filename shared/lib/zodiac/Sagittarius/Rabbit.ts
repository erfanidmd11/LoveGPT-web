  fullNarrative: `
You are warmth with purpose â€” intuitive, emotionally rich, and quietly bold in the way you move through life and love. You speak with care, love with sincerity, and chase meaning over attention. You don't fall quickly â€” but when you do, it's with your whole soul.

You're idealistic, curious, and romantically optimistic â€” but not naive. You read people's energy before trusting their words. You want love that makes you *feel safe to be soft*, while still leaving you room to wander, wonder, and grow.

In love, you're affectionate, emotionally thoughtful, and loyal once you feel emotionally respected. You offer care through presence, attentiveness, and steady emotional insight. You want a partner who respects your independence, honors your emotional truth, and *listens* without needing to fix you.

If that care or safety is broken, you don't explode. You gently retreat. And when you disappear, it's usually final â€” not out of anger, but because your heart knows when it's done giving quietly.

At work, you're introspective, ethical, and creative. You do well in roles where your vision is heard and your emotional instincts are trusted. You don't chase titles â€” you chase purpose. And when you find it, you lead with humble confidence.

In friendships and family, you're the one who holds space â€” the one who makes others feel understood, even when you're carrying your own weight in silence. But when your emotional generosity isn't reciprocated? You pull back, softly but completely.

  fullNarrative: `
You are wild with warmth â€” independent, deeply intuitive, and emotionally layered in the most graceful way. You crave freedom, but not isolation. You want partnership that lets you be *soft and strong*, adventurous and emotionally grounded. You love with curiosity, with care, and with a belief that love should expand you â€” not contain you.

You're romantic, but never desperate. You need emotional intelligence, honesty, and a connection that feels like truth. You give your loyalty slowly, but once you do, it's soft, unwavering, and deeply rooted in care.

In love, you're affectionate, idealistic, and emotionally insightful. You give with thoughtfulness, listen with your heart, and love best when you're *seen without being managed*. If someone starts to dim your light or question your rhythm, you don't fight â€” you *drift away*. Not to punish, but to protect your freedom and your peace.

You want adventure in love â€” but also safety. You crave fire â€” but only if it doesn't burn out your center. You'll go anywhere for love, as long as that love goes *with* you, not *after* you.

In work, you're creative, emotionally intuitive, and values-driven. You thrive in environments that honor meaning, people, and ideas. You lead through example, not ego. You don't seek power â€” you seek purpose.

In friendship and family, you are loyal, emotionally present, and quietly protective. You offer warmth, wisdom, and genuine connection. But when your efforts aren't appreciated or mirrored, you gently close the door and move on with your dignity intact.
