  fullNarrative: `
You are fire without apology â€” passionate, driven, fiercely independent, and emotionally complex in a way that people rarely see coming. You don't love halfway. You don't live quietly. You're all-in, all fire, all truth â€” and you expect a partner who's strong enough to meet you in that space *without flinching*.

In love, you're bold, loyal, and intense. You express emotion through action, affection, and a kind of fierce devotion that feels like both a promise and a challenge. You want passion that's mutual, honesty that cuts deep, and someone who inspires your wildness without trying to tame it.

You move fast â€” but not aimlessly. You want a relationship that expands your world, not one that shrinks it. You're loyal to the bone once you're in, but if your heart is disrespected, your exit is immediate. No speeches. No drama. Just *gone*.

You're a romantic in motion â€” unpredictable, present, and protective. You don't do emotional mediocrity. You do *soul-level spark*.

In work, you're a natural leader. Visionary, strategic, and relentless in pursuit of purpose. You thrive in roles that allow creativity, movement, and freedom. You inspire by being yourself â€” loudly, boldly, and with conviction.

In friendships and family, you're magnetic, fiercely loyal, and emotionally honest. You challenge the people you love â€” not to provoke them, but to *elevate* them. If they mistake your fire for recklessness, they don't know you at all.

  fullNarrative: `
You are wildness with wisdom â€” fearless, emotionally deep, intensely romantic, and absolutely unwilling to settle for a love that makes you shrink. You don't ask for permission. You ask *better questions*. You love out loud, live in truth, and walk away from anything that tries to clip your wings.

In love, you're passionate, honest, and loyal in a way that feels like both protection and provocation. You want a connection that *awakens* you, not just soothes you. You'll give your entire heart â€” but only to someone who earns your fire with consistency, clarity, and strength.

You're not here for soft lies or romantic politeness. You want real. You want truth. You want someone who's not afraid of your intensity â€” someone who rises with it, respects it, and knows how to *stand in the fire* without trying to put it out.

You crave freedom and connection at the same time â€” and you don't believe you should ever have to choose. If someone disrespects your rhythm, dulls your flame, or gives emotional inconsistency? You're out. No drama. No second-guessing. Just forward motion.

In work, you're a powerhouse. Driven, visionary, and assertive. You shine in roles that require leadership, creativity, or disruption. You don't follow â€” you *lead*, even when you're not trying.

In friendship and family, you're magnetic, protective, and raw. You bring laughter, truth, and loyalty that doesn't flinch â€” but you expect that same fire back. When it's not returned? Your silence speaks louder than any confrontation ever could.
