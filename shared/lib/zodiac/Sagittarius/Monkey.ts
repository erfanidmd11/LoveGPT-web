  fullNarrative: `
You are fire with finesse â€” fast-moving, emotionally aware, and clever in ways that make people both smile and think. You don't just connect â€” you *ignite*. You love with spontaneity, speak with truth, and live in pursuit of what feels *alive*.

In love, you're flirtatious, emotionally agile, and deeply loyal once someone proves they can dance with your rhythm. You need freedom, yes â€” but also depth. You want a partner who can laugh with you, think with you, and see past your wit into the passion and wisdom underneath.

You show love through energy, ideas, and full presence â€” when you're engaged, you're *all in*. But when connection feels dull, controlling, or emotionally shallow? You drift â€” not with malice, but because your soul doesn't do halfway.

You're loyal, but never stagnant. You'll stay if it grows with you. You leave if it holds you back.

In work, you're quick-witted, insightful, and highly capable in fast-paced, idea-driven environments. You thrive on innovation, connection, and variety. You're rarely the rule follower â€” but always the problem-solver.

In friendships and family, you're dynamic, entertaining, and surprisingly protective. You show up through humor, insight, and motion â€” and while you may avoid heavy emotions at first, your care runs deep for those who earn your trust.

  fullNarrative: `
You are freedom with a heartbeat â€” playful, bold, emotionally sharp, and rooted in truth that makes people feel alive just by being around you. You laugh quickly, feel deeply, and love with a kind of energy that only intensifies when it's real.

In love, you're magnetic, spontaneous, and full of fire â€” but you're also emotionally precise. You give your loyalty slowly but with depth. You want connection that's rich in truth, steeped in presence, and full of movement *without manipulation*.

You need freedom â€” not because you're afraid to commit, but because you know who you are *without* someone. You'll give your whole heart when you feel both seen and safe â€” but if your spark is dimmed or your loyalty is questioned, you won't explain. You'll *exit* â€” with grace, fire, and no regrets.

You love through action, ideas, and presence. You don't do small talk. You want soul talk â€” laughter, truth, adventure, and emotional honesty that feels like it's going somewhere *real*.

In work, you're intelligent, fast-moving, and purpose-driven. You thrive in creative, dynamic, or people-oriented environments that give you room to stretch â€” not scripts to memorize. You lead with intuition and fire â€” and your presence shifts rooms.

In friendship and family, you're the joy-maker and the truth-speaker. You hold others with care and wit, and your loyalty runs deeper than most expect â€” but if it's not reciprocated, your detachment is immediate and complete.
