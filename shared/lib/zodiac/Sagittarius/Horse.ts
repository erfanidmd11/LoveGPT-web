  fullNarrative: `
You are fire in motion â€” spontaneous, bold, emotionally attuned, and deeply committed once your soul says yes. You don't do love by the book â€” you write your own chapters. You lead with truth, crave connection that expands you, and never stay where your spirit feels confined.

In love, you're expressive, flirtatious, and loyal when it's real. You don't fake feelings â€” and you won't force them either. You want fire *and* freedom. A partner who respects your need for independence but stays emotionally close without chasing or clinging.

You're passionate and protective. You show love through movement â€” through showing up, through experiences, through the kind of devotion that speaks in presence, not pressure. If someone tries to control or slow you down? You leave â€” not out of fear, but out of clarity.

You're not afraid to love boldly, but you are selective. You need someone who keeps pace with your soul, not just your lifestyle.

In work, you're visionary, energetic, and purpose-driven. You thrive in roles that allow creativity, momentum, and leadership without rigidity. You inspire through authenticity â€” and you're usually ten steps ahead in both heart and strategy.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, generous, and deeply protective. You show up in your own way, often through laughter, insight, and bold encouragement. But if your loyalty is misused or your truth ignored? You walk â€” no warning needed.

  fullNarrative: `
You are a wildfire with intention â€” bold, emotionally intuitive, and utterly uncontainable in the best way. You live by truth, move by instinct, and love like someone who *knows her worth* and refuses to settle for anything that dims her brilliance.

In love, you're fiercely loyal, emotionally expressive, and wildly protective once you've chosen someone who *sees you*. You want partnership, not possession. Freedom, not distance. Intimacy, not attachment. You need space to grow and a partner who cheers your expansion â€” not fears it.

You love through action, movement, and unfiltered honesty. You're spontaneous, magnetic, and deeply passionate. But if your spirit is stifled, or your loyalty tested, you won't argue â€” you'll exit. No theatrics. Just clarity and forward motion.

You want a love that runs with you â€” not one that tries to slow you down. A partner who knows how to hold space for both your fire *and* your softness, because you're both. Always have been.

In work, you're driven, charismatic, and purpose-led. You do best where vision meets freedom. You inspire by showing others what it means to live out loud â€” and with heart.

In friendship and family, you're protective, uplifting, and deeply present in your own rhythm. You show up in ways that feel like energy, not obligation. And if someone confuses your independence for indifference? They didn't understand you in the first place.
