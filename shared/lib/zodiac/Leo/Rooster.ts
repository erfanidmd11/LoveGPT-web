  fullNarrative: `
You are fire with a framework â€” magnetic, principled, and built to lead with both presence and precision. You walk into a room and set the tone. Not with arrogance â€” with *clarity*. You know who you are, what you value, and what you're willing to fight for.

You lead with intention. You love with loyalty. You protect what you build â€” and expect others to treat your heart with the same respect you bring to the table. You're not interested in love that plays games â€” you want partnership that honors your passion, your presence, and your pride.

In love, you're confident, consistent, and deeply protective. You give through structure â€” through acts of care, follow-through, and showing up *when it counts*. You're loyal to the people who earn it, and you expect the same in return. Disrespect? Dishonesty? Inconsistency? You'll never ask twice for clarity â€” you'll be gone before the apology finishes forming.

You're emotionally intelligent but reserved. You feel deeply, but often translate that into action, not words. You lead through responsibility, but there's softness beneath your discipline â€” and only those who love you right ever get to see it.

In work, you're a powerhouse. You thrive where expectations are high and excellence is non-negotiable. You're precise, composed, and built for leadership that *lasts*. You don't just want to succeed â€” you want to make something meaningful, something that reflects your values.

In friendships and family, you're dependable, loyal, and quietly protective. You may not overshare, but you *always show up*. And when you give your loyalty, it stays. But if it's taken for granted, you leave quietly â€” and never reopen that door.

  fullNarrative: `
You are grace with a fire core â€” poised, polished, and grounded in fierce emotional clarity. You don't chase attention. You command *respect*. You know who you are, what you deserve, and you're not afraid to require it â€” in love, life, or legacy.

You are high standard, high heart. Emotionally intelligent but rarely emotionally impulsive. You give love with devotion, structure, and presence â€” but only when it's real. You want connection with consistency. Passion with purpose. Loyalty without conditions.

In love, you're warm, loyal, and fiercely protective â€” once someone earns their way into your inner circle. You'll nurture, inspire, and defend the person you love. But if your values are crossed or your love disrespected? You don't explode. You *elevate* â€” up and out. Quietly. Cleanly. Finally.

You love through action, precision, and devotion. But you don't beg. You don't chase. You walk â€” with your crown still straight â€” if the energy stops matching what you're worth.

In work, you are magnetic and dependable. You lead with clarity and authority, often without needing to raise your voice. You thrive in structure, elevate teams, and shine in any environment that respects excellence and gives you space to *own your brilliance*.

In friendship and family, you're the one who remembers, protects, and *shows up*. You give deeply, guide without ego, and offer loyalty few ever forget. But if you feel taken for granted, your emotional door doesn't slam â€” it *closes softly*. And doesn't reopen.
