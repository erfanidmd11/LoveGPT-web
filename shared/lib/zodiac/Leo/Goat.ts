  fullNarrative: `
You are passion with a paintbrush â€” emotionally rich, creatively gifted, and fiercely protective of the love and energy you offer to the world. You don't need to be the loudest in the room to lead. You lead through warmth, sincerity, and the kind of love that lingers.

You are romantic, but not reckless. Loyal, but not naive. You feel things deeply and express them with care â€” through art, words, touch, or simply being present when it matters. You carry strength wrapped in softness, and that contrast makes you unforgettable.

In love, you're attentive, affectionate, and emotionally tuned in. You love big, but you love *deliberately*. You won't rush into anything that doesn't feel emotionally aligned. You want beauty in your connection â€” shared values, emotional safety, and a rhythm that lets you breathe and *be fully seen*.

But when you're hurt, you don't confront â€” you retreat. You overthink. You give silently and expect others to understand your depth without asking. And when that love goes unacknowledged? You quietly start closing the door â€” no drama, just distance.

In work, you shine in emotionally intelligent or creatively expressive roles. You lead best with inspiration and care â€” not control. You thrive in spaces that honor both your ideas and your emotional integrity. Purpose matters more than power.

In friendships and family, you're the protector with a poetic heart. The one who remembers the little things. Who shows up without being asked. Who gives without needing to be seen â€” but still hopes someone notices.

  fullNarrative: `
You are softness wrapped in strength â€” graceful, emotionally attuned, and quietly magnetic. You move with beauty, love with intention, and hold your boundaries with the kind of calm that teaches others what self-respect looks like.

You lead with care, but not passivity. You speak gently, but never without meaning. Your loyalty is deep, your love is sincere, and your energy makes people feel safe just by being in your presence. But you don't give your heart easily â€” it has to *feel right*.

In love, you are poetic, nurturing, and passionate â€” but also emotionally discerning. You crave a connection that's both grounding and expressive. You'll pour yourself into someone who matches your depth, mirrors your softness, and respects your fire. But if someone disrespects your emotions, misreads your care, or confuses your kindness for weakness? You'll exit â€” with grace, but without looking back.

You love to create beauty â€” in relationships, in your environment, in how you express affection. You're not loud in love, but you are *present*. You show up. You remember. You feel deeply â€” and expect your partner to be capable of the same.

In work, you're often the silent force behind success. Creative, thoughtful, emotionally intelligent, and driven by meaning. You shine in spaces where empathy and excellence can coexist. You're not here for shallow work â€” you want what you build to *matter*.

In friendships and family, you're the emotional heartbeat. Loyal, giving, and intuitive, you support those you love with a soft hand and fierce protection. But when your effort isn't matched? You pull back â€” not to punish, but to restore yourself.
