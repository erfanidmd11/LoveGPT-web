You are fire and force â€” a man who leads from instinct, speaks from passion, and loves like it's war *and* worship. You don't whisper your presence â€” you *announce it* by simply entering the room. You're bold, emotionally intense, and always running on some deep internal truth most people can't quite decode.

You're not here to be ordinary. You want greatness â€” in love, in life, in legacy. You're driven by loyalty, fueled by desire, and emotionally complex under all that heat. You offer protection with pride and presence, and when someone earns your trust? They get a man who will go to battle for their peace.

In love, you're passionate, deeply affectionate, and fully *there* â€” until something shakes your confidence. You want a partner who respects your fire and loves you through your chaos. You need to be admired, yes â€” but more than that, you need to be *understood*. You want connection that feels earned, not easy.

But you can be reactive. When hurt, you either rage or retreat. Vulnerability is hard â€” not because you can't do it, but because you've learned to guard your softness like it's sacred. You'd rather roar than cry â€” even when you're doing both inside.

In work, you're bold, visionary, and magnetic. You thrive in leadership, creative, or mission-driven roles. You don't follow â€” you build. And when people see what you're capable of, they *follow you*, even if they don't understand how you move.

In friendships and family, you're protective, generous, and a little wild. You show up hard â€” but you need space to be *you*. If someone tries to tame your energy or underestimate your heart? They lose access, and you won't explain twice.

  fullNarrative: `
You are the fire everyone feels â€” even before you speak. Bold in presence, wild in heart, and fiercely protective of your freedom *and* your feelings, you lead with emotion and power that refuses to be tamed. You don't chase â€” you attract. And you don't apologize for being "too much" â€” you know you're *just enough* for the right one.

You feel everything fully. You love loudly, defend fiercely, and walk away gracefully when something stops feeding your soul. You're a natural leader, not because you try â€” but because your energy commands attention. You are passion, presence, and purpose all wrapped in one unapologetic woman.

In love, you're magnetic, intense, and deeply loyal â€” but you're also discerning. You want a partner who sees your fire, respects your freedom, and *earns* the softness that lives under your confidence. You love through acts of loyalty, affection, and protection. But if you're betrayed? The exit is swift â€” and unforgettable.

You're not afraid of emotional intensity. You *thrive* in it. But you won't waste it on people who can't match your energy or show up consistently. You don't just want attention â€” you want *alignment*. Love that is wild, rooted, and worthy of your fire.

In work, you're unstoppable when you care. Creative, driven, and naturally influential, you excel in roles that allow leadership, autonomy, and expression. You're not built to be managed â€” you're here to *build something real*.

In friendships and family, you're the protector, the motivator, the one who shows up even when you're hurting. You love your people with everything â€” but you expect that same energy in return. When it's not there? You walk. Not bitter â€” just *done*.
