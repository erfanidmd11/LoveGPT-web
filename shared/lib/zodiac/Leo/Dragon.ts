You are fire with focus â€” driven, emotionally rich, and impossible to ignore. You lead with instinct, love with devotion, and live like legacy is the only option. You're the kind of man who sets the tone in every room, not by trying â€” but by *being*.

You love big. You protect hard. You're not afraid of emotion â€” you *run* on it. But your intensity isn't reckless. It's precise. Intentional. When you choose someone, you're *all in*. Loyalty isn't a buzzword for you â€” it's how you breathe. But if someone betrays that? You're gone. And you don't return.

In love, you're passionate, affectionate, and emotionally dominant in the best way. You want a partner who respects your fire, holds your emotional depth, and doesn't flinch when you show up loud, soft, wild, or still. You give everything â€” time, energy, protection â€” and you want to be seen for the *realness* of that gift.

But vulnerability doesn't come easy. You guard your heart with confidence, leadership, and action. Underneath the fire is a softness you rarely show â€” not because it's weak, but because it's sacred.

At work, you're a natural leader. You don't just build â€” you *elevate*. You're at your best when vision, emotion, and influence collide. You won't thrive under someone else's shadow â€” you were born to light your own way and pull others forward with you.

In friendship and family, you're fiercely loyal, emotionally available (when safe), and highly protective. But if your effort goes unnoticed or unappreciated, you shut down. Not out of ego â€” out of self-preservation.

  fullNarrative: `
You are not subtle â€” you are stunning. A firestorm in heels with a heart that loves like a fortress and protects like a kingdom. You carry yourself like someone who doesn't just *know* her worth â€” but dares the world to forget it.

You love big. You give without apology. And you expect to be met with presence, power, and truth. You don't do half-effort. You don't do emotional guesswork. You need a partner who sees your light, doesn't flinch at your fire, and *chooses you with clarity*.

In love, you are expressive, romantic, and protective. You show affection with intensity, generosity, and loyalty that runs deeper than most can handle. But if you are disrespected â€” emotionally, energetically, or spiritually â€” you disappear with grace and *never look back*.

You crave a partner who understands you can be soft *and* strong, nurturing *and* unapologetic, romantic *and* untamed. You'll give them everything â€” but only if they don't ask you to shrink to fit their comfort.

In work, you are a visionary, a creator, and a builder of legacies. You thrive in leadership, creative direction, or anything that allows you to move with bold purpose. You don't chase influence â€” it chases you.

In family and friendship, you're loyal, fiercely protective, and emotionally devoted. But if someone takes your love for granted, they'll feel the distance before you ever say a word. Your love is sacred. And your standards? Non-negotiable.
