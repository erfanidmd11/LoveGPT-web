  fullNarrative: `
You are a firestarter with a heart â€” bold, magnetic, and impossible to ignore. You move fast, love hard, and don't stay where the energy feels stale. You need movement, passion, purpose â€” and a partner who doesn't try to tame you, but knows how to *ride with you*.

You're a romantic, but not in the traditional way. You express love through adventure, through spontaneity, through showing up *in the moment*. You're loyal â€” but on your terms. You don't fall easily, but when you do, it's real, it's fierce, and it's loud.

In love, you're passionate, affectionate, and emotionally generous. But you also need space â€” not to leave, but to breathe. You love best when you're respected for both your energy and your depth. If someone tries to control or cage you? You bolt. Not out of immaturity â€” but self-preservation.

You want a connection that inspires â€” not limits. You need chemistry, but also freedom. Depth, but also lightness. You'll give everything to someone who can match your fire without dimming it.

In work, you're driven, dynamic, and visionary. You don't just lead â€” you *ignite*. You're at your best when you believe in what you're doing, when you have space to innovate, and when no one's trying to micromanage your magic.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, protective, and always in motion. You show up when it matters. You bring life to every space. But if you feel emotionally stifled, overlooked, or disrespected â€” your withdrawal is fast, fierce, and final.

  fullNarrative: `
You are wildfire in lipstick â€” bold, intuitive, endlessly charismatic, and impossible to box in. You lead with fire, live with purpose, and love like someone who's rewriting every rule. You don't chase â€” you attract. And you don't stay where you're not met *with presence, passion, and truth*.

You love with heat. With heart. With everything. But only once someone shows they understand your rhythm: freedom first, then depth. You're not here for clinginess, control, or emotional confusion. You want clarity. Intensity. A connection that burns *and* builds.

In love, you're affectionate, adventurous, and fiercely loyal. You crave passion, but you also need respect â€” for your space, your energy, your mind. You're not afraid of intimacy â€” you're afraid of being trapped by people who don't know what to do with your softness *and* your spark.

If you're disrespected, you don't argue â€” you vanish. Not out of cruelty, but protection. Your time, your heart, your loyalty? All sacred. All earned.

In work, you shine where creativity meets leadership. You need room to move, innovate, and express. You don't wait for opportunities â€” you create them. You're magnetic in front of people and powerful behind the scenes.

In family and friendships, you're the loyal protector and fiery motivator. You show up hard â€” but when you feel unseen, unheard, or emotionally exhausted, you'll pull away without a word. You give your light to many, but only let a few near your flame.
