You are fire dressed in silk â€” calm on the surface, powerful beneath it, and always in quiet control of your world. You don't lead with noise. You lead with presence, precision, and the kind of emotional command that people feel before you even speak.

You are a man who doesn't just love â€” you *claim*. When you commit, it's not performative â€” it's full-body, full-spirit, and fiercely loyal. You expect the same in return. You're not here for chaos, games, or emotional guessing. You want honesty, emotional strength, and connection that respects your depth *and* your discipline.

In love, you are sensual, emotionally intense, and protective. You love with subtlety â€” through action, through attention, through loyalty that doesn't waver. But you're also a master of emotional restraint. You rarely show all your cards â€” and only reveal your vulnerability to the few who've truly earned it.

Your energy is alluring, but selective. You give your best when you feel safe â€” emotionally, mentally, energetically. And if someone betrays your trust or disrespects your rhythm? They won't get a second invitation. You won't fight â€” you'll vanish, with quiet confidence.

In work, you're composed, strategic, and deliberate. You thrive in leadership, design, strategy, or any environment that rewards intellect and intuition. You hate being rushed. You love mastery. And when you're invested, you bring excellence that speaks for itself.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, thoughtful, and protective â€” but private. You support in silence, offer advice when it matters, and watch everything before stepping in. If you're taken for granted? You leave without making noise â€” but the silence *stings*.

  fullNarrative: `
You are elegance with an edge â€” a woman who doesn't need to be loud to be powerful. You speak with intention, move with purpose, and love with quiet depth. You're not chaotic â€” you're *curated*. And while your presence is graceful, your emotional world runs deep, bold, and unshakably loyal.

You love slowly, selectively, and with sharp discernment. You're not the type to give your heart quickly â€” you observe, you test, you *feel* everything before you let anyone close. But once you choose someone? You become their greatest protector, quiet champion, and most sacred confidante.

In love, you're sensual, deeply romantic, and emotionally intelligent. You're a partner who watches energy before words. You love through subtleties: thoughtful gestures, steady presence, and the kind of emotional understanding that only the truly intuitive possess. But betrayal? Emotional disrespect? That gets you out the door before anyone notices you've left.

You crave respect, loyalty, and emotional maturity. You're not here to raise someone emotionally â€” you want an equal. Someone who respects your emotional rhythm, honors your space, and never mistakes your softness for something to be managed.

In work, you're composed, strategic, and highly effective. You lead best through precision and intuition, and you're often the one in the room who already knows the outcome before the meeting begins. You don't compete loudly â€” you *win quietly*.

In family and friendship, you are loyal, nurturing, and highly protective. You create safe emotional spaces, hold secrets without flinching, and remember the details no one else saw. But if your care is taken for granted, your emotional exits are graceful â€” and irreversible.
