  fullNarrative: `
You are charm with a sharp edge â€” fast-thinking, emotionally agile, and built to entertain *and* protect. You know how to light up a room and disarm someone in five words or less. But behind all the flash and fire is a man with real depth â€” if someone sticks around long enough to earn it.

You're quick â€” with your words, your decisions, your heart. You love excitement. You thrive on spontaneity. But you also crave emotional connection more than you let on. You want someone who can play in your world â€” and still meet you in the quiet moments when the show ends.

In love, you're flirtatious, expressive, and magnetic. You love hard when you're in it â€” with devotion, humor, and surprising tenderness. But if the emotional vibe gets off, or the connection feels stale? You'll pull back fast â€” not out of disinterest, but self-preservation.

You want loyalty. Respect. Fun. You need someone who lets you be *you* without trying to contain your chaos â€” and knows when your jokes are covering something you don't know how to say yet.

In work, you're a whirlwind of brilliance and energy. You shine in fast-moving, creative, people-driven environments. You're not here for the same old routine â€” you're here to *innovate*, challenge, lead, and inspire. You thrive when your voice is heard, and your mind is trusted.

In family and friendship, you're loyal, entertaining, and emotionally sharper than people expect. You show up in your own way â€” with laughter, with insight, with fierce protection. But if someone underestimates your depth, they'll only ever get your performance â€” not your heart.

  fullNarrative: `
You are charm in heels â€” quick, clever, bold, and wrapped in laughter that hides entire chapters of emotional truth. You move through the world like a spark â€” igniting inspiration, curiosity, and desire wherever you go. But under all that shine is a woman who *feels deeply* and guards her softness like a sacred flame.

You love boldly, but you test before trusting. You flirt with ease, but your heart is earned. You'll give your energy to many, but your loyalty to few â€” and if someone fumbles that trust? They'll never get another chance. You don't believe in begging to be loved â€” but you *do* expect to be seen.

In love, you're fiery, playful, and deeply loyal once you feel safe. You crave romance that keeps up with your mind and doesn't flinch when you shift from lighthearted banter to emotional intensity. You want passion, yes â€” but also *presence*. If someone tries to contain you, they'll lose you. If they hold space for you? You'll give them a loyalty that doesn't quit.

At work, you're dynamic, persuasive, and built for innovation. You thrive when given space to lead, think out loud, and *move*. You're not built for emotional stagnation â€” you're built for transformation. You're best when your creativity and freedom are respected.

In friendships and family, you're the life of the room, the protector behind the curtain, and the one who lifts everyone with your energy. But when you feel emotionally drained, you withdraw â€” quietly. Your absence says what your words never will.
