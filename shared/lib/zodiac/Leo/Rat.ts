  fullNarrative: `
You are power and precision wrapped in charm. You lead with presence, speak with confidence, and think in strategies â€” not just instincts. You know how to win a room with a smile and quietly map out every emotional nuance happening inside it.

You want to be respected, not just liked. You crave admiration â€” but only when it's earned. You don't chase the spotlight just to be seen; you chase it when you know you have something *worth showing*. And when you love? You give loyalty, fire, and protection that few ever forget.

In love, you're bold, attentive, and calculated in the best way. You don't rush in recklessly â€” you scan, you assess, you choose. But once you choose, you go all in. You're deeply loyal, quietly emotional, and crave a partner who matches your intensity without stealing your independence.

You give through effort. Through presence. Through protecting what you love like it's an extension of your own identity. But if you feel manipulated, disrespected, or emotionally dismissed? You cut ties with calm precision â€” and rarely look back.

At work, you're a visionary with practical instincts. You're strategic, hardworking, and excellent under pressure. You lead naturally â€” not with volume, but with clarity and competence. You thrive when you're building something you *believe in*, and crumble when your efforts go unnoticed for too long.

In friendships and family, you're deeply loyal, emotionally guarded, and protective of your circle. You won't let everyone in â€” but those who earn your trust have a leader, a strategist, and a silent guardian for life.

  fullNarrative: `
You are fire and finesse â€” bold in energy, elegant in execution. You know who you are and what you bring, and you don't need to scream it â€” your presence *says it all*. People feel your confidence. They see your brilliance. But very few ever get close enough to witness the depth behind your shine.

You lead with heart and head. You're emotionally intelligent, intellectually sharp, and naturally strategic â€” a rare combination that makes you unforgettable in love and unstoppable in life. You give loyalty like a crown â€” earned, sacred, and not easily taken away.

In love, you are warm, attentive, and wildly magnetic. You need admiration, yes â€” but not from *everyone*. Just from the one who actually sees all of you: the fire, the softness, the loyalty beneath your command. You don't settle. You don't beg. But you *do* love with every ounce of your soul once someone proves they're worthy.

You need honesty, strength, and emotional safety. And if someone tries to dim your light or toy with your heart? You don't fight. You *exit* â€” fiercely, silently, and with your dignity fully intact.

In work, you're organized, high-achieving, and naturally persuasive. You thrive in leadership roles or anywhere your intelligence and charisma can create real impact. You're not here to play small. You're here to build something *that lasts* â€” and bring people up with you as you do it.

In friendship and family, you are protective, intentional, and dependable. You love hard â€” but expect respect in return. And if someone disrespects your boundaries or drains your energy, you won't argue â€” you'll simply disappear and never look back.
