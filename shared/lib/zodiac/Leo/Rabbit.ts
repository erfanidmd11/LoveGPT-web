  fullNarrative: `
You are charm with depth, confidence wrapped in compassion. You don't demand attention â€” you *earn* it. With presence, patience, and emotional depth that surprises people once they realize you're more than just a kind face and quick smile.

You are a protector by nature. You nurture those you care about, but never in loud, showy ways. You lead with warmth, love with intention, and rarely let your guard down until someone proves they deserve to see what's behind your glow.

In love, you're romantic, present, and full of small, sacred gestures. You're attentive, emotionally consistent, and deeply loyal â€” once trust is established. You're not here to play games â€” you're here to build connection that lasts. But if you feel emotionally dismissed or disrespected, you won't cause drama. You'll simply *stop showing up*.

You love peace, but you are not passive. You carry pride in how you show up, and you hold your standards close to your heart. You want love that feels safe, soulful, and honest â€” something that doesn't require you to overperform to be seen.

In work, you're thoughtful, responsible, and quietly creative. You thrive in roles that allow you to make a difference â€” where emotional intelligence is an asset, not a liability. You're rarely the loudest voice, but often the most respected presence in the room.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, protective, and often the emotional glue. You offer support without being asked, love without pressure, and forgiveness when it's been earned. But your silence is sacred â€” and when it arrives, it usually means something that once felt safe no longer does.

  fullNarrative: `
You are the warmth people remember â€” gentle, generous, emotionally present, and quietly regal. You don't need to take up space to be felt. You enter softly but stay loudly in people's hearts, and your love has a way of *settling* people â€” like sunlight after a storm.

You love through care, protection, consistency, and softness. But don't mistake your grace for passivity â€” your boundaries are real, and your intuition cuts through energy like a blade dressed in silk. You *know* when something's off, even when no one says a word.

In love, you're affectionate, loyal, and romantic â€” but also emotionally discerning. You give when it's real. You nurture when it's safe. You stay when it's *worth it*. You want love that feels rooted, honest, and soulful. And when it's not? You won't make noise â€” you'll just make an exit.

You don't beg for love. You attract it through presence. And if someone mishandles your softness? They don't get a second chance to hold it.

At work, you are thoughtful, precise, and quietly high-achieving. You don't need to be loud â€” your grace is your leverage. You shine in roles where emotional intelligence, people care, creativity, or stability are needed. You're often the one people confide in â€” even when they don't know why they trust you so fast.

In friendships and family, you're the emotional anchor. You listen, soften tension, and remember things others forget. But if your emotional energy isn't honored, you pull away â€” not to punish, but to protect your peace.
