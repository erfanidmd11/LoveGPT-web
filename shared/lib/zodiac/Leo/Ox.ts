  fullNarrative: `
You are strength in motion â€” focused, consistent, and deeply rooted in purpose. You don't chase approval. You lead with presence. You build your life brick by brick, and when you love someone, they feel the *security* of being chosen by a man who means every move he makes.

You don't say much until it matters. You watch. You assess. And when you commit â€” to a goal, to a partner, to a promise â€” you hold your word like a sacred bond. You are dependable, principled, and grounded in loyalty that doesn't shift with the mood of the day.

In love, you are steady, devoted, and intentional. You show up â€” through action, through protection, through making sure the person you love has everything they need. You aren't flashy with affection, but when someone earns your heart, they gain a quiet guardian â€” someone who defends, provides, and *stays*.

But your emotional world? That takes time. You don't open easily, and vulnerability doesn't feel natural. You want connection, but on solid ground. Chaos or immaturity will never get close to your heart â€” you simply won't let them in.

In work, you're a builder and a leader. You value results over recognition. You're excellent under pressure, strong in routines, and rarely off course. People may underestimate you â€” until they realize you're the one they're all depending on.

In family and friendship, you're protective, loyal, and structured. You remember what matters. You keep your promises. You give your all â€” but you expect loyalty and respect in return. If those are broken, you won't make a scene â€” you'll simply *never be available in the same way again*.

  fullNarrative: `
You are strength wrapped in elegance â€” composed, consistent, and quietly magnetic. You lead with purpose, love with clarity, and stay grounded even when the world spins. You don't raise your voice â€” you raise the *standard*. You know who you are, and you build your world like a woman who's not here to prove â€” but to *protect and preserve* what matters.

In love, you're deeply loyal, practical, and committed. You don't love casually â€” you choose carefully, then give your best. You're not dramatic with emotion, but you love with presence, intention, and care that runs deep. You want someone who respects your rhythm, mirrors your stability, and doesn't flinch when you show your softer side under all that strength.

You create emotional safety, often without being asked. You are nurturing by nature â€” not by obligation. But if your love is taken for granted or your loyalty is mishandled, you don't explain. You *retract* â€” gracefully, permanently, and without drama.

In work, you're structured, dependable, and high performing. You set the tone in professional spaces â€” bringing quiet leadership, integrity, and unwavering standards. You don't chase attention â€” but when something's falling apart, you're the one holding it together.

In family and friendship, you are the emotional and logistical backbone. The one who remembers, supports, follows through, and protects. But you need reciprocity. You need someone who sees *you*, not just what you do. Otherwise, the love you gave so freely becomes unavailable â€” silently, but completely.
