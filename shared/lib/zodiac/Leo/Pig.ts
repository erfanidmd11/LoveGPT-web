  fullNarrative: `
You are warmth with a backbone â€” a deeply loyal, emotionally generous man who leads with heart and never shows up halfway. You don't chase attention â€” but when you give yours, it's focused, full, and felt. You are the kind of man who remembers how someone takes their coffee, texts after a hard day, and shows up without needing to be asked.

You love through presence, patience, and consistent affection. You're romantic, but not performative. You want connection that's real â€” slow-burning, rooted, and emotionally safe. You're a giver, a nurturer, and someone who will pour into the people you love â€” so long as that love is appreciated, not assumed.

In love, you're all in â€” when it's safe. You're loyal to a fault, deeply affectionate, and protective of your peace. But if your kindness is taken for granted or your love isn't reciprocated? You won't cause a scene. You'll just *go quiet*. And when you do, it's usually final.

You're emotional â€” and proud of it. But you rarely ask for what *you* need until you're on empty. You prefer to be the strong one. The steady one. The one others can count on. But underneath that steadiness is a man who needs to be held, too.

At work, you're consistent, thoughtful, and values-driven. You thrive in environments where care, creativity, or leadership are valued. You don't just want to succeed â€” you want to do something that *means something*.

In friendship and family, you're the anchor. The one who offers support, love, humor, and loyalty without needing recognition. But when you feel taken for granted, your energy pulls back â€” and your absence is felt more than your presence was acknowledged.

  fullNarrative: `
You are softness with a glow â€” nurturing, loving, and steady in ways that make people feel held and seen. You offer warmth without being asked, loyalty without hesitation, and joy that fills every room you walk into. You love out loud, and you *mean* it â€” but only when it's earned.

Your emotional generosity is unmatched â€” but it's also sacred. You give deeply, love freely, and support fiercely. But once someone shows they can't handle your heart with care, you protect your peace like it's a kingdom â€” and no one gets back in without doing the work.

In love, you are loyal, affectionate, and deeply romantic. You remember the little things. You give through acts of kindness, quiet support, emotional presence, and open-hearted attention. But you expect to be met with that same sincerity. You're not interested in being adored for your warmth â€” you want to be *understood* for your depth.

If you're overlooked, dismissed, or emotionally taken for granted, you won't always speak up. You'll just *stop giving*. Softly. Subtly. And eventually, permanently. Not out of bitterness â€” but because you know how sacred your energy really is.

In work, you are dependable, creative, and heart-driven. You thrive in roles that allow your emotional intelligence and passion to shine. You don't need the spotlight â€” but your presence uplifts every space you're in. You're not afraid to lead with care â€” and you do it better than most.

In family and friendship, you're the emotional anchor, the nurturer, the one who gives more than anyone realizes. You're always there â€” until you're not. Because once you start feeling emotionally invisible, you quietly disappear to protect the love that lives in you.
