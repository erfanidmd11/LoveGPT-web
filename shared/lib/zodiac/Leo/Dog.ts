You are the man people trust instinctively â€” not because you're the loudest, but because you're *real*. You love with quiet fire, lead with integrity, and protect the people you care about like it's your sacred purpose. You don't play games. You build things â€” relationships, homes, futures â€” and you do it all with consistency and depth.

In love, you're loyal, affectionate, and emotionally anchored. You want something real. You're not here for mind games, mixed signals, or performative romance. You want peace. Partnership. Loyalty. Someone who values trust as much as you do â€” and knows that love is something you *show up for* daily.

You don't fall easily, but once you're in, you're *all in*. You love through presence, through showing up, through choosing someone even on the hard days. And if that love is disrespected? You walk â€” slowly, firmly, without drama.

At work, you're steady, principled, and dependable. You thrive in environments built on values, service, or consistency. People may overlook you at first â€” until they realize you're the one holding the structure together. You lead without ego, but with unmistakable presence.

In friendship and family, you're the one who remembers the details, shows up without being asked, and holds people to the same standard of loyalty you live by. You're emotionally wise, but you rarely over-share. When you're hurt, your silence is the signal â€” and few get a second chance if they miss it.

  fullNarrative: `
You are loyalty with a lionheart â€” calm, protective, emotionally attuned, and never easily shaken. You carry warmth in your presence, wisdom in your silence, and power in your stillness. You don't love loudly for show â€” you love deeply, consistently, and with *intention*.

In love, you're steady, loyal, and emotionally mature. You don't need drama to feel alive â€” you want connection that feels safe, rooted, and reciprocal. You offer loyalty, compassion, and strength. You want someone who sees the *depth* behind your composure â€” someone who values presence over performance.

You're not afraid to protect your peace. If something feels off, you won't wait for a grand betrayal â€” you'll walk away from anything that doesn't honor your heart. Not with fireworks. With dignity.

You offer reliability in a world obsessed with chaos. But you're not boring â€” you're brave. You speak truth with grace, love with depth, and hold your people fiercely. But if your energy is taken for granted, your exit is quiet and *permanent*.

In work, you're organized, emotionally intelligent, and full of quiet power. You do your best in environments that align with your values â€” structure, integrity, and purpose. You don't need applause â€” you *need meaning*.

In family and friendship, you're the emotional foundation. You remember the details, support through storms, and love people in ways that last. But your boundaries are real. If your effort isn't matched, your loyalty is withdrawn without warning â€” and you never make the same mistake twice.
