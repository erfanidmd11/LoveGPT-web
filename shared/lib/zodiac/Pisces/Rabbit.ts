  fullNarrative: `
You are peace wrapped in presence â€” emotionally intuitive, quietly romantic, and deeply devoted to those you trust. You don't chase chaos â€” you *nurture calm*. In love, you seek something soft but *soulful*, rooted in emotional safety and mutual understanding.

In love, you are deeply affectionate, loyal, and sincere. You fall slowly, but once you do, you give completely. You want a partner who honors your gentleness without mistaking it for weakness â€” someone who cherishes emotional intimacy as much as you do. You're not here for games. You're here for *real connection*.

You love through presence, devotion, and emotional attentiveness. You notice what others miss. You hold space without pressure. You offer tenderness not as a performance, but as a *practice*. But if your heart is taken for granted or your emotional boundaries crossed? You *quietly disappear*. Not out of anger â€” but out of self-protection.

In your work, you are creative, steady, and values-driven. You're drawn to meaningful work â€” something that aligns with your soul. You bring harmony to your environment, and people often feel calmer in your presence, even when you say little.

With friends and family, you're loyal, nurturing, and quietly protective. You won't compete for attention â€” but when someone earns your loyalty, you offer them *a home inside your heart*.

  fullNarrative: `
You are tenderness in motion â€” emotionally rich, deeply intuitive, and quietly powerful. You don't just feel love â€” you *become* it. Every glance, every word, every subtle shift â€” you *sense* it all. And you crave a connection that honors your emotional depth without asking you to harden.

In love, you are soft yet discerning. You give your heart with care, but once trust is earned, your devotion runs *soul-deep*. You want a partner who protects your sensitivity, respects your silence, and meets your gentle energy with both patience and presence. You are romantic in the most sacred way â€” not for fantasy, but for *truth that feels like poetry*.

You love through nurture, consistency, and spiritual warmth. You give quietly, love deeply, and often without needing to be asked. But if your emotional giving is dismissed, or your sensitivity met with insensitivity? You don't raise your voice â€” you *retreat*. Softly. Entirely. Without resentment, but with resolve.

In work, you are steady, creative, and heart-led. You do best in environments that feel calm, emotionally safe, and values-aligned. You're the quiet center of stability in spaces filled with noise â€” and that is your quiet superpower.

In friendships and family, you are loyal, intuitive, and emotionally present. You hold people gently but firmly. You make others feel safe â€” often before you feel fully seen yourself. And as you grow, you're learning to hold space for *your own heart* too.
