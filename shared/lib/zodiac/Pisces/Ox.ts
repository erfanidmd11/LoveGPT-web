  fullNarrative: `
You are depth in motion â€” emotionally rich, deeply introspective, and grounded in a sense of purpose that doesn't waver. You don't speak to impress â€” you speak when it *matters*. And in love, you seek something sacred: *peace that feels like home* and passion that feels *earned*.

In love, you're consistent, thoughtful, and devoted. You offer quiet romance and unwavering presence. You want a partner who values emotional stability, respects your need for reflection, and sees your stillness not as silence â€” but as *strength*. You may not be quick to open, but once you're in, you love with your whole soul.

You love through acts of service, protection, and deep emotional presence. You show up when it counts. You don't need dramatic expressions to prove love â€” your loyalty *is* the proof. But if your emotional rhythm is disrespected or your values crossed? You *detach* â€” not impulsively, but with firm inner knowing.

In work, you're methodical, purpose-driven, and quietly visionary. You may not be flashy, but your foundation is *unshakable*. You build with care, lead with intention, and carry the weight of others without seeking credit.

With friends and family, you are loyal, protective, and trustworthy. You may not let everyone in, but those who earn your heart find a home in it. You're a rock â€” gentle on the surface, but impossible to move when you're grounded in love.

You are stillness with soul â€” graceful, emotionally layered, and quietly resilient. You carry a depth that doesn't demand attention, but *commands* it. You're not here for surface love â€” you're here for *sacred connection* that honors your softness and mirrors your strength.

In love, you are nurturing, principled, and emotionally present. You give your heart carefully, but completely. You want a partner who sees the quiet intensity behind your calm exterior â€” someone who respects your inner world, values consistency, and offers emotional safety without restriction.

You love through loyalty, small details, and steady devotion. You don't need to be loud to be *true*. You protect what you love with a kind of strength that's invisible but immovable. But if your loyalty is unreciprocated or your trust betrayed? You don't beg. You *let go* â€” gently, and with dignity.

In your work, you're reliable, purposeful, and self-motivated. You thrive in roles that allow for depth and creativity without chaos. You don't chase spotlight â€” you *become the foundation* others depend on.

With friends and family, you're deeply loving, emotionally intelligent, and protective. You may not open up to everyone, but when you do, your love is unconditional â€” and your boundaries, non-negotiable.
