You are heart and honor â€” emotionally present, spiritually grounded, and fiercely devoted to what (and who) you believe in. You don't just love â€” you *stand for it*. You protect it. And you crave a relationship that mirrors the way you show up: *fully and faithfully*.

In love, you are gentle, deeply loyal, and principled. You want a partner who meets your emotional sincerity with emotional maturity â€” someone who can be soft without being fragile, and steady without being rigid. You're not afraid of emotional work â€” you just want to know it's *mutual*.

You love through protection, presence, and subtle emotional depth. You are quietly romantic â€” you don't make a show of love, but you *live it*. You hold space, you show up, and you stay long after others would've walked. But if your values are disrespected, your loyalty tested, or your vulnerability dismissed? You *exit* â€” with calm conviction.

In your work, you're dependable, emotionally intelligent, and driven by meaning over recognition. You prefer roles where you can serve, support, or *stand for something real*. You're a quiet leader â€” powerful because you listen, not because you shout.

With friends and family, you're protective, sincere, and always the emotional anchor. People come to you when they need truth wrapped in tenderness. You don't offer advice casually â€” when you speak, it's *with heart*.

  fullNarrative: `
You are tenderness with a spine â€” emotionally rich, spiritually faithful, and protective of your heart and the hearts you hold. You don't just believe in love â€” you *devote* yourself to it. Not blindly, but with a sacred kind of care.

In love, you are nurturing, deeply loyal, and emotionally attuned. You give your all when you feel emotionally safe â€” and you build that safety through patience, softness, and unwavering consistency. You want a partner who understands your emotional intuition and meets it with truth, not just charm.

You love through subtle actions, protective energy, and quiet devotion. You're not loud about your feelings â€” but when you love, it's *written into everything you do*. But if your trust is broken, your boundaries ignored, or your sensitivity taken for granted? You don't scream. You *retreat* â€” and once you go, you rarely come back.

In your work, you are driven by meaning and emotional alignment. You are dependable, nurturing, and drawn to helping others feel seen and safe. You don't seek attention â€” you bring *impact through intention*.

With friends and family, you are deeply loyal and protective. You offer emotional refuge â€” the kind of presence that steadies others. You expect honesty, return loyalty, and hold people close with quiet strength.
