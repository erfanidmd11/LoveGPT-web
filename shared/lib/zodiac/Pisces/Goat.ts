  fullNarrative: `
You are emotion with depth â€” soft-hearted, wise, and quietly fierce in your love. You don't rush. You *feel*. You observe. You nurture. And in love, you want something more than attraction â€” you want *sanctuary*. A place where your soul can exhale.

In love, you're romantic, gentle, and fiercely loyal. You crave connection that feels emotionally safe, spiritually attuned, and filled with care. You want a partner who listens with presence, loves with purpose, and never asks you to harden in order to be strong.

You love through tenderness, loyalty, and emotional generosity. You're attuned to subtle shifts in energy. You give without keeping score â€” and often, without needing to be asked. But if your sensitivity is disrespected or your peace disturbed? You don't shout. You *withdraw*. Gracefully. And completely.

In your work, you're creative, thoughtful, and often quietly influential. You prefer purpose over power, and harmony over hustle. You bring vision with softness â€” and lead through empathy, not ego.

With friends and family, you are nurturing, emotionally available, and selectively expressive. You may not be the loudest voice in the room, but you're the most *felt*. You hold space like a lighthouse â€” calm, steady, and deeply healing.
