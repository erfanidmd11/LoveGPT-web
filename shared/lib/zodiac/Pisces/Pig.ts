  fullNarrative: `
You are heart before armor â€” soulful, kind, emotionally open, and guided by the quiet fire of your ideals. You move through life with compassion, and in love, you don't play games â€” you *give everything*, as long as it feels safe and sincere.

In love, you're deeply romantic and emotionally present. You seek a connection that is soft but real, vulnerable but safe. You want a partner who understands your need for both stillness and soul-stirring passion â€” someone who appreciates your tenderness and never takes it for granted.

You love with care, devotion, and deep sensitivity. You're the one who remembers the little things, listens without fixing, and gives even when you're tired â€” because love, for you, is sacred. But if your generosity is taken advantage of or your heart mishandled? You walk away â€” not to punish, but to protect what's sacred in *you*.

In work, you're intuitive, dedicated, and values-driven. You thrive in creative, compassionate spaces where kindness is an asset â€” not a weakness. You lead with empathy and serve with soul.

With friends and family, you're loyal, nurturing, and emotionally available. You give endlessly, often sensing what others feel before they say a word. But you're learning now that love isn't just about giving â€” it's also about *receiving*.

  fullNarrative: `
You are love in its purest form â€” gentle, giving, deeply intuitive, and endlessly romantic. You don't chase intensity â€” you crave *authenticity*. You long for love that feels like home, like healing, like two souls who *choose each other* over and over again.

In love, you're nurturing, loyal, and emotionally generous. You give from the heart â€” not to impress, but to express. You want a partner who respects your tenderness, understands your inner rhythms, and never confuses your softness with fragility. You don't just feel love â€” you *devote* yourself to it.

You love through acts of service, emotional presence, and quiet emotional devotion. You offer peace. You hold space. You feel everything â€” and you *stay*, even when it's hard. But if your loyalty is taken for granted, your kindness ignored, or your energy drained? You won't scream â€” you'll *leave quietly*â€¦ and rebuild in silence.

In work, you're creative, purpose-driven, and guided by intuition. You flourish in environments that honor your values, allow for empathy, and give your imagination space to breathe. You create beauty without needing credit â€” because for you, *impact is emotional*.

With friends and family, you're the soft landing â€” the one who listens without judgment and gives without being asked. You're learning that your care is sacred â€” and only those who *earn it* get to keep it.
