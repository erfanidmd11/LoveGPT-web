  fullNarrative: `
You are depth behind stillness â€” emotionally rich, spiritually tuned, and hard to read by design. You don't show everything â€” not because you lack depth, but because you *protect it*. In love, you move slowly, watch closely, and give fully â€” once trust becomes sacred.

In love, you are poetic, passionate, and precise. You crave soul-level intimacy but move cautiously toward it. You want a partner who sees your silences as full of feeling, not absence. Who knows your loyalty doesn't come quickly â€” but when it arrives, it's *undeniable*.

You love through observation, intentional care, and a sense of calm intensity. You don't need to perform your feelings â€” you embody them. You speak in subtlety, and your devotion runs deeper than your words suggest. But if you feel emotionally misunderstood, manipulated, or rushed? You *disengage* â€” not with drama, but with clarity.

In your work, you're contemplative, creative, and quietly powerful. You combine vision with intuition. Strategy with feeling. You thrive where your insight is valued â€” and your rhythm honored.

In friendships and family, you are protective, discerning, and extremely loyal to the few you let in. You hold space gently â€” but never casually. You are the safe harbor for the people who learn how to anchor near you.

  fullNarrative: `
You are mystery with meaning â€” emotionally layered, deeply intuitive, and unshakably romantic in your soul. You don't chase attention â€” you attract *energy*. You feel everything, say only what matters, and love in a way that's both ancient and rare.

In love, you're sensual, soulful, and discerning. You open slowly â€” not out of fear, but out of *wisdom*. You crave a partner who moves with emotional awareness, honors your spiritual sensitivity, and sees your silence not as withdrawal â€” but as *depth preparing to be shared*.

You love through subtlety, sacred presence, and powerful intuition. You don't need loud gestures â€” you need soul-level recognition. When you trust, your devotion is magnetic. But if your intuition is ignored or your vulnerability dismissed? You *vanish*. Quietly. Entirely. Without drama, but with *divine finality*.

In work, you are graceful, strategic, and mystically creative. You combine emotional insight with a discerning mind. You don't work to be seen â€” you work to feel aligned. And when you're in alignment, your presence shifts entire spaces.

With friends and family, you are loyal, emotionally present, and extremely protective of your energy. You give only to those who make it sacred to receive. And those who earn your trust find in you a healer, a confidante, and a rare kind of emotional clarity.
