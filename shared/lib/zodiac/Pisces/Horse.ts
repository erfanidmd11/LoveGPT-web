  fullNarrative: `
You are motion with meaning â€” romantic, intuitive, emotionally complex, and wildly independent. You move through the world like a poem with wings â€” chasing feeling, following beauty, and longing for a love that doesn't confine, but *elevates*.

In love, you are passionate, expressive, and soulful. You don't fall easily, but when you do, you fall with intensity. You want a partner who inspires your imagination, respects your emotional rhythm, and knows that your freedom is not a threat â€” it's a *requirement for your loyalty*.

You love through presence, passion, and emotional truth. You offer your heart in moments of vulnerability and creative chaos. You crave connection that feels like mutual wonder â€” not mutual dependence. But if you feel emotionally boxed in, dismissed, or misunderstood? You don't fight. You *disappear* â€” into thought, into movement, into yourself.

In work, you're visionary, fluid, and often guided by instinct more than structure. You thrive when your creativity is given space to breathe. You don't just work for success â€” you work for *soul-aligned purpose*.

With friends and family, you're warm, unpredictable, and loyal in the moments that count. You may vanish for stretches, but when someone truly knows you, they understand: you always return â€” with more depth, more story, and more *heart*.

  fullNarrative: `
You are emotion in motion â€” poetic, powerful, spiritually vibrant, and beautifully uncontainable. You move through love the way you move through life â€” by feeling, not by formula. You don't just want a partner â€” you want a *soul mirror* who won't hold you back, but will *run beside you*.

In love, you're passionate, idealistic, and full of emotional color. You want romance that feels like art â€” expressive, raw, and true. You crave connection that honors both your emotional depths and your wild nature. A love that lets you be both *mystic and flame*.

You love through freedom, feeling, and fierce presence. You give everything â€” your truth, your loyalty, your dreams â€” but only to someone who understands that your need to roam is not distance, it's *devotion that breathes*. But if you feel emotionally boxed in or spiritually dismissed? You won't just fade. You'll *fly* â€” without apology.

In work, you're creative, driven by meaning, and allergic to monotony. You bring passion to purpose, and you're most alive when your inner world has space to shape the outer one. You don't just do tasks â€” you create *ripples*.

With friends and family, you're loving, protective, and profoundly intuitive. You feel everything, often before others do. You show up where it matters â€” even if your path winds in unexpected directions.
