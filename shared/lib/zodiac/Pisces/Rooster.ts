  fullNarrative: `
You are order in the ocean â€” emotionally perceptive, inwardly imaginative, and outwardly composed. You live in two worlds: one that dreams, and one that *delivers*. And in love, you seek someone who doesn't just understand your duality â€” they *respect it*.

In love, you are emotionally loyal, romantically traditional, and spiritually sincere. You want deep emotional connection â€” but within the safety of structure. You crave a partner who appreciates your quiet devotion, doesn't rush your emotional process, and recognizes that your seriousness is born from *sacred intention*.

You love with presence, consistency, and subtle sensitivity. You're not performative â€” but you're *precise*. You'll show up early, stay late, remember the details, and hold space for your partner's truth â€” even when you haven't spoken your own yet. But if your loyalty is dismissed or your emotional rhythm misunderstood? You *withdraw*. Firmly. Fully. With quiet resolution.

In work, you are diligent, principled, and emotionally attuned to what others miss. You bring a balance of compassion and accountability. You lead with structure â€” but your structure always has *soul*.

With friends and family, you are reserved but deeply dependable. You may not open up quickly, but those who know you understand: your love is built in layers â€” slow, sincere, and *unshakably loyal* once established.

  fullNarrative: `
You are structure wrapped in softness â€” deeply emotional, beautifully intuitive, and quietly exacting in love. You carry your heart with care and your boundaries with grace. You believe in romance â€” not as fantasy, but as a *sacred partnership* rooted in truth.

In love, you are nurturing, clear, and emotionally generous â€” once trust is built. You want a partner who respects your depth, honors your emotional cadence, and never confuses your sensitivity for weakness. You lead with quiet devotion, but you expect emotional maturity in return.

You love through intentional presence â€” small acts, subtle affirmations, and deep listening. You give emotionally, but not recklessly. And if you feel dismissed, rushed, or disrespected? You *leave*. Not with drama â€” but with dignity that speaks volumes.

In your work, you are purposeful, detail-oriented, and values-driven. You bring order to emotional complexity and wisdom to high-pressure moments. You're not loud â€” you're *impactful*. You don't seek perfection â€” you seek *alignment*.

With friends and family, you're loyal, nurturing, and principled. You give deeply, but selectively. You are the one people come to when they want clarity and calm â€” not chaos. You hold space for others, but you're learning to hold that same space for *yourself*.
