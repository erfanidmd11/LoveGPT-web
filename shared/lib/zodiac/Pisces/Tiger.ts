  fullNarrative: `
You are fire in the ocean â€” emotionally intense, imaginative, fiercely loyal, and led by a heart that feels *everything*. You move through the world with passion disguised as peace, and when you love, you don't just commit â€” you *immerse*.

In love, you are romantic, protective, and complex. You crave emotional depth and soul-level connection, but you also need freedom to express yourself fully. You want a partner who understands your mood swings aren't confusion â€” they're *compassion in motion*. Someone who can hold your sensitivity and meet your intensity â€” without trying to tame either.

You love with passion, vulnerability, and artistic fire. You give your all â€” sometimes before making sure it's safe. You write poetry with your presence, protect with your silence, and dream louder than you speak. But if you feel misunderstood, trapped, or emotionally dismissed? You'll leave â€” not loudly, but completely.

In work, you're driven by meaning, creativity, and heart. You are magnetic in your vision and grounded in your empathy. You lead by inspiring, not by demanding â€” and people follow because they feel *seen*.

In friendships and family, you are loyal, unpredictable, and incredibly nurturing when you trust. You may struggle to feel understood â€” but your love, once earned, is *legendary*.

  fullNarrative: `
You are a storm of soul â€” wildly expressive, emotionally intuitive, fiercely independent, and impossible to ignore. You don't just feel love â€” you *embody* it. Deeply. Loudly. Without apology. You're not afraid of intensity â€” you *are* intensity wrapped in intuition.

In love, you are passionate, nurturing, and protective. You crave connection that is both emotionally deep and energetically wild. You want a partner who honors your sensitivity as a *superpower*, not a flaw. Someone who understands that your love language is devotion â€” but also *freedom*. You need to feel safe enough to *feel everything*.

You love through fire and flow â€” bold gestures, emotional vulnerability, and a kind of loyalty that's spiritual. You give all of you â€” even the parts still healing. But if your heart is dismissed, your rhythm controlled, or your vulnerability exploited? You *leave*. Fully. And with a quiet strength that never looks back.

In your work, you're visionary, artistic, and emotionally fueled. You lead with passion and purpose. You thrive in spaces where your creativity and compassion can coexist â€” where truth doesn't have to be quiet.

With friends and family, you're loving, fierce, and always *present*. You feel what others don't say, and protect what others don't see. You give deeply â€” but are learning to give with boundaries, not burnout.
