  fullNarrative: `
You are passion in a dream â€” intense, visionary, emotionally deep, and romantically untamed. You don't just feel life â€” you *channel* it. You carry a fire within, but you lead with softness â€” a paradox that makes your presence both magnetic and mysterious.

In love, you're poetic, fiercely loyal, and driven by soul-level connection. You crave intimacy that's spiritual, passionate, and emotionally expansive. You don't settle for "normal" â€” you want love that *transforms*. Someone who sees your chaos and calls it beautiful. Who holds your depth, not just your charm.

You love with intensity and grace â€” through sweeping gestures, deep eye contact, and emotional truth. You give your heart in waves, always honest, always full. But if your vulnerability is dismissed or your loyalty questioned? You withdraw â€” not in anger, but in sacred self-protection.

In work, you're bold, creative, and purpose-driven. You blend vision with emotion, leadership with imagination. You don't just create â€” you *transmit*. Your presence turns ideas into movement. People may not always understand you â€” but they *feel* you.

With friends and family, you're loyal, emotionally generous, and wildly protective of those you trust. You choose your circle carefully â€” but once you're in, you're *all in*.

  fullNarrative: `
You are soul with fire â€” emotionally vast, spiritually attuned, and impossibly captivating. You don't just dream â€” you *feel entire worlds into existence*. You move through life with a romantic intensity that's both ethereal and electric. In love, you need magic â€” not performance. Depth â€” not drama.

In love, you're poetic and powerful. You give your heart with depth and drama, honesty and softness. You want a partner who isn't afraid to dive in â€” someone who reveres your emotional world without trying to control it. You crave connection that moves through both fantasy and *fierce truth*.

You love like an artist â€” with beauty, fire, and full-body presence. You give all of you â€” not in pieces, but in poetry. But if your intuition is ignored or your devotion dismissed? You walk away â€” not in rage, but in silence that echoes louder than words.

In work, you are magnetic, imaginative, and spiritually guided. You're not here for ordinary â€” you're here to *transform*. Whether creating, leading, or healing, you bring a depth that others can't replicate â€” because it comes from *within*.

With friends and family, you are nurturing, deeply loyal, and emotionally attuned. You sense what others feel before they say it, and love them harder because of it. You're the lighthouse â€” but you're learning to *return that light inward*.
