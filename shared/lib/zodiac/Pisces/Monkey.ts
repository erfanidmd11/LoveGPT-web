  fullNarrative: `
You are poetry in motion â€” playful, emotional, unpredictable, and wildly imaginative. You think in metaphors, feel in waves, and love with a kind of charm that's both mischievous and magnetic. You want connection that doesn't cage your spirit â€” but *calls it home*.

In love, you're flirtatious but emotionally sincere. You test with humor, but bond with vulnerability. You need a partner who can laugh with you, think with you, *feel with you* â€” someone who won't try to solve your depth, but simply sit inside it.

You love through thoughtfulness, surprise, and emotional intelligence. You connect with words, with energy, with small gestures that carry big meaning. But if your feelings are misunderstood, your freedom restricted, or your complexity dismissed? You detach â€” with softness, but certainty.

In your work, you're imaginative, adaptive, and driven by curiosity. You're here to create â€” whether that's beauty, ideas, solutions, or emotion. You work best when your environment allows you to move between structure and spontaneity with ease.

With friends and family, you're loyal in moments that matter most. You show up with insight, laughter, and unexpected depth. You might seem light-hearted on the surface â€” but those who know you understand your inner world runs *deep*.

  fullNarrative: `
You are soul with sparkle â€” wildly intuitive, emotionally rich, playfully mysterious, and endlessly curious. You carry the rare gift of turning emotion into art and chaos into beauty. You crave love that is both *sacred and spontaneous* â€” deep, but never dull.

In love, you're affectionate, mischievous, and subtly profound. You flirt with wit and connect through energy. You want a partner who stimulates your mind, understands your emotional waves, and never mistakes your need for space as a lack of devotion. You require emotional intelligence and the *freedom to feel freely*.

You love with nuance â€” showing affection in poetic bursts, quick glances, deep presence, and unpredictable joy. You give quietly, but meaningfully. But if you feel misunderstood, stifled, or emotionally dismissed? You retreat. Sometimes in silence. Sometimes in artistry. But always with intention.

In work, you're fluid, imaginative, and drawn to projects with soul. You need freedom to create, room to dream, and people who trust the *way* you work â€” even if it doesn't look conventional. You're not here to follow paths â€” you're here to *reimagine them*.

With friends and family, you're warm, intuitive, and fiercely loyal once trust is built. You feel more than you show, and care more than you say. You offer healing in the form of presence â€” and sometimes poetry.
