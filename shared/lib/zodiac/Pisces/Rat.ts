You are intuition with a plan â€” poetic yet calculated, gentle yet discerning, and quietly magnetic in your depth. You live in the realm of possibility but move through the world with intention. You don't just dream â€” you *design*.

In love, you're romantic, emotionally intelligent, and observant. You crave a connection that's equal parts heart and mind. You want a partner who's emotionally open, intellectually curious, and respectful of your sensitivity without *trying to fix it*. You offer soulful presence, but only where there's *substance*.

You love through attentiveness, loyalty, and subtle devotion. You don't always announce your feelings â€” you show them in small, meaningful ways. But if your emotional generosity is manipulated or your trust broken? You don't rage. You *release* â€” quietly, and permanently.

In work, you're strategic and idealistic â€” a rare blend of visionary and tactician. You're drawn to purpose-driven paths that let your creativity and empathy coexist. You may move quietly, but your impact runs deep.

In friendships and family, you are loyal, thoughtful, and often the emotional anchor. You pick up what others miss. You offer safety without fanfare. You may not always feel understood â€” but your love is never in question to those who *matter*.

  fullNarrative: `
You are dream wrapped in discipline â€” emotionally layered, deeply intuitive, and intellectually sharp beneath your soft exterior. You don't just feel deeply â€” you *understand* deeply. You crave connection that honors both your tenderness and your intelligence.

In love, you are romantic, reserved, and richly emotional. You give with quiet devotion, but only to those who move with care. You want a partner who sees past your sweetness and into your *strategy* â€” someone who respects your emotional world without trying to manage or define it.

You love through gestures, presence, and intuitive care. You remember the details, sense the shifts, and hold space without needing credit. But if your trust is broken or your softness is mistaken for weakness? You retreat. *Entirely*. With dignity and a silence that speaks louder than explanation.

In work, you're thoughtful, creative, and quietly powerful. You blend vision with caution â€” moving when it feels right, not just when it looks right. You're not made for loud rooms, but when you speak, people *listen*.

With friends and family, you're loyal, nurturing, and profoundly empathetic. You absorb more than you show, love deeper than you admit, and are often the quiet emotional compass for those around you. You give â€” but you're learning to give *without losing yourself*.
