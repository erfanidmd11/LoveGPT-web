  fullNarrative: `
You are structure with edge â€” intellectually precise, emotionally self-contained, and quietly rebellious in your beliefs. You don't perform. You *build*. And when it comes to love, you want depth, direction, and a partner who understands your rhythm without trying to rewrite it.

In love, you are thoughtful, loyal, and emotionally intentional. You don't love loudly â€” you love *accurately*. You want a connection that stimulates your mind, respects your autonomy, and leaves room for your internal world to breathe. You don't open quickly, but when you do, your loyalty is unwavering â€” and your presence is steady.

You love through consistency, insight, and high standards. You don't throw words around â€” you back them up. You believe in truth over charm, clarity over chaos. But if your emotional intelligence is dismissed or your boundaries are crossed? You *disengage* â€” not in anger, but in integrity.

In work, you're methodical, strategic, and grounded in purpose. You bring precision to everything you touch. You don't chase attention â€” your results speak. And while others get distracted by noise, you stay loyal to your *vision*.

With friends and family, you're dependable, discerning, and deeply loyal once trust is earned. You're not the loudest in the room â€” but you're the one people turn to when things get real. You're a quiet protector with an unshakable core.
