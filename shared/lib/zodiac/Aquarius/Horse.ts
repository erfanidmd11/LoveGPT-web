  fullNarrative: `
You are motion with meaning â€” dynamic, visionary, and emotionally intricate beneath your free-spirited surface. You don't move for the sake of movement â€” you move for *truth*. For experience. For the kind of love that feels like *expansion*, not expectation.

In love, you are passionate, magnetic, and hard to pin down â€” not because you fear commitment, but because you *crave connection that feels alive*. You want a partner who matches your pace, respects your space, and doesn't try to tame the parts of you still in flight. You need freedom, but you also long for something real â€” something that meets your mind, not just your motion.

You love through excitement, presence, and bursts of emotional clarity. You express through experience, not routine. But if you feel controlled, misunderstood, or emotionally boxed in? You won't explain yourself. You'll *disappear*. Fast. And with no desire to be followed.

In work, you are creative, entrepreneurial, and allergic to monotony. You thrive when building things from the ground up â€” when the rules are yours to break and the direction is *yours to define*. You're a natural disruptor with a heart that's as driven by curiosity as it is by impact.

In friendships and family, you are fiercely loyal, though sometimes distant. You care deeply â€” even when you don't always show it. And when someone earns your trust, they'll find a defender who shows up *exactly when it matters* â€” even if not always when expected.

  fullNarrative: `
You are the storm and the sky â€” bold, emotionally intelligent, unapologetically free, and fiercely loyal to your inner truth. You don't seek permission to be who you are â€” you *become it* more fully with every step. Love, for you, must feel like liberation â€” not limitation.

In love, you are electric, passionate, and hard to predict. You crave depth, but not demand. Romance, but not restriction. You want a partner who sees your freedom as a gift â€” not a threat. Someone who doesn't just admire your fire, but *knows how to hold it without smothering it*.

You love through intensity, curiosity, and meaningful spontaneity. You're generous with your energy when you feel emotionally safe â€” and distant when you don't. You don't chase validation â€” you *attract connection* through your authenticity. But if you feel boxed in, criticized, or emotionally controlled? You *bolt*. Not because you're afraid â€” but because you *know your worth*.

In work, you're visionary, dynamic, and built for creation over repetition. You thrive in roles where innovation and freedom lead. You're not made for rigid systems â€” you're here to build *new ones* that reflect your ideals.

In friendship and family, you're loyal, loving, and incredibly protective â€” but only once trust is earned. You're not surface-level, even when you're social. You crave soul-aligned relationships that grow with you â€” not against you.
