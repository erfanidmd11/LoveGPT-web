  fullNarrative: `
You are silence with depth â€” thoughtful, emotionally reserved, deeply loyal, and intellectually electric. You don't move fast â€” you move *intentionally*. You don't speak to be heard â€” you speak to *reveal*. And when it comes to love, you seek more than romance â€” you seek *resonance*.

In love, you are observant, protective, and hard to fully read. You reveal in layers â€” each one earned, not offered. You want a partner who respects your internal rhythm, thinks for themselves, and understands that your loyalty may be quiet â€” but it's *absolute*. You don't fall easily, but when you do, it's all in.

You love through stillness, strategy, and subtle emotional consistency. You don't perform affection. You *become* safety. But if your intelligence is insulted, your emotions dismissed, or your independence threatened? You won't argue. You'll *exit*. Completely. With dignity and no explanation.

In your work, you're calculated, visionary, and quietly magnetic. You don't need praise â€” your results *speak*. You're at your best when blending logic with intuition, ideas with systems. You influence without needing the spotlight.

With friends and family, you are loyal but minimalist. You choose few â€” and you choose *deep*. You show up when it matters, even if no one sees how hard you worked to do so.

  fullNarrative: `
You are stillness with spark â€” deeply intuitive, emotionally intricate, and fiercely devoted to your own truth. You don't reveal yourself to be seen â€” you reveal when it feels *safe*. In love, you don't need attention. You need *alignment*.

In love, you're elegant and enigmatic â€” warm beneath the surface, but discerning at the edges. You want a partner who sees your soul before they try to hold your hand. Someone who values depth over display, curiosity over control, and who understands that silence, for you, is often sacred â€” not distant.

You love through precision, presence, and emotional intelligence. You give loyalty not through declarations, but through consistency. But if that loyalty is disrespected, or your inner world is misunderstood? You don't chase. You *close the door* â€” respectfully, and for good.

In work, you're visionary, refined, and highly strategic. You don't move just to move â€” you move when the outcome matters. You lead quietly but powerfully, weaving insight with instinct. People trust your calm â€” even when they don't understand your full range.

With friends and family, you're deeply protective and emotionally perceptive. You don't open to many, but when you do, your loyalty is sacred. You don't need to be loud to be *felt*. Your love is deliberate. Lasting. And deeply *earned*.
