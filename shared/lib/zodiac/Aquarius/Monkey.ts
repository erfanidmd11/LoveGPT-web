  fullNarrative: `
You are brilliance in motion â€” clever, unpredictable, emotionally layered, and constantly evolving. You live in questions, not conclusions. In love and in life, you're drawn to the spark â€” of conversation, of chemistry, of consciousness.

In love, you're magnetic, playful, and hard to pin down â€” not because you're afraid to commit, but because you crave *depth that moves*. You need a partner who can keep up with your ideas, give you room to breathe, and never mistake your independence for indifference. You want connection, not control â€” stimulation, not stagnation.

You love through humor, loyalty, and mental intimacy. You're affectionate in unconventional ways â€” spontaneous texts, deep midnight conversations, unpredictable acts of care. But if you feel emotionally boxed in, micromanaged, or misunderstood? You *exit* â€” sometimes physically, sometimes emotionally â€” but always *intentionally*.

In your work, you're dynamic, innovative, and built to challenge outdated systems. You need freedom to think, space to play, and impact that matters. You're most alive when solving problems others don't even know exist yet â€” and doing it *your way*.

With friends and family, you're loyal, entertaining, and emotionally perceptive â€” even if you don't always let others know how much you *feel*. You're not as aloof as people think. You're just protective of your complexity â€” and careful about where you place your heart.

  fullNarrative: `
You are chaos and clarity â€” mentally agile, emotionally intricate, and beautifully unpredictable. You don't just walk your own path â€” you *design it*, redraw it, and question why it was ever paved that way to begin with. In love, you need stimulation, sovereignty, and someone who doesn't just admire your complexity â€” but *respects* it.

In love, you're magnetic, clever, and emotionally layered. You show up with curiosity and depth â€” but only once someone earns your trust. You need a partner who meets you in mind *and* emotion, who doesn't try to label you, fix you, or rush your rhythm. You're not afraid of connection â€” you're afraid of being *reduced* inside of it.

You love through laughter, insight, and subtle loyalty. You're affectionate in waves â€” playful one moment, private the next. But if your emotional freedom is dismissed, your pace pressured, or your complexity misunderstood? You *detach* â€” with quiet precision and no second-guessing.

In your work, you're a visionary and a disruptor. You thrive in spaces where your originality isn't just tolerated â€” it's celebrated. You don't just think outside the box â€” you make *new blueprints*. You are creative leadership embodied.

With friends and family, you're loyal, witty, and fiercely protective of your space and energy. You connect through depth and humor â€” but guard your inner world carefully. When you choose someone, it's with full intention.
