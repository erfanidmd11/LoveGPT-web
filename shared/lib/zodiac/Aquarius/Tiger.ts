  fullNarrative: `
You are fire in the wind â€” wild, intelligent, emotionally intense, and unapologetically free. You don't follow rules â€” you *rewrite them*. In love, you want soul, spark, and *sovereignty*. Anything less feels like a cage.

In love, you're magnetic, unpredictable, and fiercely loyal â€” once someone proves they can hold space for your depth without dimming your light. You crave a partner who is strong enough to stand beside your power, curious enough to explore your mind, and brave enough to embrace your chaos *without controlling it*.

You love through energy, adventure, and intensity. You show affection in motion â€” through bold loyalty and spontaneous intimacy. But if you feel emotionally stifled, betrayed, or underestimated? You won't fight for understanding â€” you'll *leave*. Quietly or explosively, but always with clarity.

In your work, you're inventive, passionate, and unapologetically bold. You break ceilings, disrupt systems, and build new models. You were not born to blend in â€” you were born to *lead revolutions*. Quiet ones. Loud ones. Internal ones. Every kind.

In friendship and family, you're protective, intuitive, and honest to the core. You don't sugarcoat truth, and you don't tolerate masks. When you love someone, they know it â€” fully. Fiercely. Undeniably.

  fullNarrative: `
You are instinct with intellect â€” unpredictable, magnetic, fiercely independent, and mentally *untouchable*. You don't just think outside the box â€” you question why the box was ever there. In love, in life, in legacy â€” you move with vision, not permission.

In love, you are passionate yet paradoxical â€” deeply loyal, yet emotionally elusive. You crave a connection that stimulates your mind and honors your rhythm. You want freedom that doesn't feel like distance, and intensity that doesn't turn into control. A partner must earn your trust â€” not by containing you, but by *understanding* you.

You love through inspiration. Through ideas, bold gestures, and unexpected depth. You may vanish to recalibrate, but when you return, you bring clarity, not confusion. If you feel boxed in, dismissed, or emotionally minimized? You won't argue. You'll *disappear* â€” fast, free, and firm.

In work, you're electric â€” rebellious with reason, and magnetic without trying. You don't follow trends â€” you *create* movements. You're at your best when building what doesn't yet exist, and when leading without needing the spotlight.

With friends and family, you're unpredictable but fiercely protective. You don't open up to everyone, but when you do, you become someone's fiercest defender â€” loyal even when distant, and dependable when it matters most.
