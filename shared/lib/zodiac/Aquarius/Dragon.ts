  fullNarrative: `
You are thunder in the clouds â€” magnetic, driven, emotionally complex, and unwilling to play small. You don't just think differently â€” you *exist* differently. In love, in leadership, in life â€” you're here to challenge norms and write new maps.

In love, you are passionate and paradoxical. You give loyalty, but on your terms. You want a partner who doesn't try to tame you â€” who brings depth, not demand. You crave both wild freedom and soul-level connection, but only with someone who can meet you in *truth*, not control.

You love through energy, devotion, and intensity â€” often more felt than explained. You lead through emotion, though you rarely reveal the softer layers. But if you feel emotionally cornered or underestimated? You rise â€” not to prove, but to *reclaim* your power. And you'll walk away before you ever betray your own integrity.

In your career, you're magnetic, purpose-driven, and disruptive in the best way. You think far ahead of the crowd and inspire others through courage, not conformity. You're not here to maintain the system â€” you're here to *transform* it.

With friends and family, you're fiercely loyal, emotionally layered, and protective. You keep your inner circle small, but for those who earn your loyalty, you'll burn the world down to protect their peace.

  fullNarrative: `
You are brilliance in motion â€” rebellious, radiant, emotionally potent, and entirely your own force of nature. You don't adapt â€” you *redefine*. You don't chase â€” you *attract*. And when it comes to love, you crave a connection that matches your fire, not just your form.

In love, you are powerful and paradoxical. You're fiercely loyal once chosen, but fiercely protective of your freedom. You open slowly â€” not because you fear love, but because you *respect* it. You want a partner who inspires your mind, awakens your soul, and never tries to shrink your intensity for their comfort.

You love through energy, conviction, and visionary passion. You don't whisper â€” you *transform*. But if your truth is challenged, your loyalty questioned, or your independence threatened? You will walk away â€” not to prove a point, but to protect your power. You are not afraid of starting over. You're afraid of *shrinking*.

In your work, you're unstoppable â€” creative, strategic, and meant for more than mediocrity. You build empires, spark movements, and do it with grace and grit. You're not just ahead of the curve â€” you *bend* it.

With friends and family, you're magnetic, intuitive, and intensely loyal. You show up for those you love â€” fully and fiercely. But you also know when to pull back from those who can't hold your truth without fearing it.
