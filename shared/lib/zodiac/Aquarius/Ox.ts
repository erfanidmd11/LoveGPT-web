  fullNarrative: `
You are structure with spark â€” emotionally self-contained, future-focused, and grounded in logic over theatrics. You don't chase chaos or crave spotlight. You want *clarity*, loyalty, and a love that doesn't threaten your autonomy â€” it *amplifies* it.

In love, you are intentional and protective, but not impulsive. You fall in love with minds before you fall into feelings. You're not here for emotional drama â€” you're here for real, thoughtful, principle-rooted connection. You need a partner who respects your quiet power and doesn't mistake your calm for disinterest.

You love through action. Through stability. Through listening without judgment and showing up when it counts. You might not say the most â€” but you *do* the most where it matters. And if you feel emotionally manipulated or your values are crossed? You'll disengage. Silently. Cleanly. Without resentment â€” but with *finality*.

In work, you are forward-thinking, focused, and capable of building what others only dream about. You innovate without needing applause. You lead through structure and strategy â€” not ego. Your vision isn't loud, but it's *lasting*.

In friendships and family, you are steady, deeply loyal, and discerning. You don't need a big circle â€” just a real one. Those you let in know that behind your quiet exterior is a mind always calculating, and a heart that doesn't give itself away lightly.

  fullNarrative: `
You are grounded rebellion â€” disciplined, forward-thinking, emotionally reserved, and unwavering in your pursuit of truth. You're not interested in convention for convention's sake â€” you want *meaning*. Integrity. Freedom that feels like home.

In love, you are clear, loyal, and surprisingly romantic once trust is earned. You open slowly â€” not because you're cold, but because your heart is *sacred*. You crave a partner who respects your autonomy, shares your ideals, and doesn't confuse your strength with emotional unavailability.

You love through loyalty, presence, and purposeful care. You offer emotional safety, not emotional chaos. You're not performative â€” you're *intentional*. And if your values are compromised, or your worth is questioned? You walk away. Not in anger, but in *certainty*.

In your career, you're methodical and innovative â€” a rare mix of rebel and architect. You see what others miss. You make plans where others panic. You don't need attention â€” your work commands it.

With friends and family, you're protective, selective, and deeply committed. You don't give your trust easily, but once someone's in, you show up with quiet loyalty that never wavers â€” and never needs applause.
