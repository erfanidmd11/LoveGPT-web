  fullNarrative: `
You are insight in stillness â€” creative, emotionally nuanced, mentally expansive, and deeply loyal in quiet, intentional ways. You don't love loudly â€” you love *intelligently*. And in that space, you crave a connection that feels like clarity, not confusion.

In love, you are careful, selective, and deeply observant. You need to *understand* before you trust. You look for emotional safety wrapped in intellectual chemistry â€” a partner who feels like solitude without the loneliness. Someone who respects your space, moves with grace, and meets your gentleness with depth.

You love through quiet consistency, thoughtful conversation, and subtle presence. You may not express affection in flashy ways, but your care runs deep and deliberate. You listen more than you speak. And if you feel emotionally rushed, misunderstood, or unvalued? You won't argue â€” you'll *vanish*. Softly. Without apology.

In your work, you're visionary and quietly revolutionary. You think ten steps ahead and lead through thoughtful innovation, not volume. Your strength is subtle, and your creativity comes from *observation*, not validation.

With friends and family, you are loyal, sensitive, and emotionally intelligent. You don't have time for shallow connections or loud performances. You want real â€” and you'll wait for it.

  fullNarrative: `
You are softness with a spine â€” intuitive, emotionally intelligent, and unapologetically unique. You don't seek attention â€” you *attract it*, through the quiet power of being completely, authentically yourself. You love deeply, but not loudly. You connect through soul, not spectacle.

In love, you are gentle yet guarded. You crave connection that feels emotionally intelligent and energetically clean. No games. No chaos. Just clarity and care. You want a partner who sees the depth in your quiet, who protects your freedom while nurturing your heart, and who doesn't confuse your sensitivity for fragility.

You love through presence, small details, and unspoken emotional depth. You don't perform affection â€” you *embody* it. But if your heart feels unseen, pressured, or misunderstood? You don't shout â€” you *slip away*. Gently. Entirely. Without looking back.

In your career, you're innovative, perceptive, and drawn to paths that allow both impact and individuality. You work best where your ideas can breathe, and where your sensitivity is seen as an asset â€” not a flaw.

In friendship and family, you're deeply loyal and emotionally generous. You hold space for others, often without being asked. But over time, you learn to choose those who also know how to hold space for *you*.
