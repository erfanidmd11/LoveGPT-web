  fullNarrative: `
You are steadiness with a spark â€” loyal, future-minded, emotionally measured, and guided by a strong internal code. You move through life with quiet conviction, grounded not in conformity, but in *clarity*. You don't seek to impress â€” you seek to *align*.

In love, you are loyal, thoughtful, and slow to trust. You value depth over performance, truth over trend. You want a partner who walks in integrity, speaks with intention, and never tries to cage your wild mind. You're not afraid of love â€” you're afraid of *losing yourself* inside it.

You love through presence, protection, and quiet consistency. You may not verbalize emotion easily, but your actions speak volumes. When you commit, you commit with honor. But if your loyalty is taken for granted or your core values are betrayed? You don't explain. You *step away* â€” silently, and for good.

In work, you're responsible, inventive, and drawn to causes bigger than yourself. You lead with fairness, but never with ego. You're not flashy â€” but you're *formidable*. You bring ideas to life through integrity and focus.

With friends and family, you're reliable, principled, and deeply protective. You don't give trust easily, but once earned, you become a steadfast ally. You're the one people rely on when things get real â€” and they know you mean every word you say.

  fullNarrative: `
You are clarity with compassion â€” emotionally discerning, deeply loyal, and radically independent. You don't seek attention â€” you seek *alignment*. In love and life, you value truth over trend, and peace over performance. You crave connection that is thoughtful, grounded, and quietly *revolutionary*.

In love, you are devoted, emotionally intelligent, and subtly intense. You don't give your heart easily â€” but when you do, it's with integrity and full presence. You want a partner who respects your solitude, honors your mind, and never mistakes your emotional calm for disinterest. You're not afraid to commit â€” you're afraid to commit where you can't *be yourself*.

You love through protection, presence, and principle. You may not always express emotion verbally, but your loyalty is felt in everything you do. And if your emotional safety is compromised or your values are crossed? You *disengage* â€” with calm, final clarity.

In your career, you're focused, conscientious, and values-driven. You care more about purpose than praise, and your quiet leadership influences far more than you let on. You don't force â€” you *guide*. And you hold yourself to a standard most can't even see.

With friends and family, you're deeply loyal, emotionally supportive, and fiercely protective of your inner world. You don't let everyone in â€” but when you do, you show up with a kind of love that's steady, selfless, and unshakably sincere.
