  fullNarrative: `
You are intellect with instinct â€” sharp, strategic, emotionally complex, and fiercely independent. You don't follow paths â€” you *design* them. And in love, you crave connection that's as deep as it is *different*.

In love, you're unpredictable but loyal. Detached on the surface, but wildly observant underneath. You want a partner who stimulates your mind, respects your rhythm, and doesn't try to define you. You fall for people who don't cage your freedom, but *co-create* with it.

You love through curiosity, ideas, and loyalty disguised as nonchalance. You may not show your emotions traditionally â€” but when you choose someone, it's a commitment rooted in depth, not display. However, if you feel boxed in, emotionally controlled, or intellectually dismissed? You'll *vanish* â€” not to punish, but to *preserve your selfhood*.

In your work, you are a visionary â€” creative, cerebral, and driven by purpose more than praise. You don't fit molds â€” you *break* them. You solve problems others can't even see yet, and your innovation thrives when given trust and space.

With friends and family, you're loyal but selective. You prefer a tight circle of minds who get your complexity without needing to fix it. You support from the shadows, love from the margins, and protect through perspective â€” not performance.

  fullNarrative: `
You are a mystery wrapped in brilliance â€” unconventional, emotionally layered, strategically clever, and devoted to truth more than tradition. You don't follow expectations â€” you *elevate beyond them*. And in love, you seek freedom that feels like home.

In love, you're complex, deeply loyal once trust is earned, and instinctively guarded. You crave connection that honors your mental velocity and emotional sovereignty. You're not interested in roles â€” you're interested in *real*. A partner who challenges your thoughts, respects your solitude, and doesn't try to dim your light to hold it.

You love through presence â€” not performance. Through depth disguised as detachment. Through subtle loyalty and spontaneous support. But if your independence is threatened or your intellect dismissed? You *pull back*. Not to punish â€” but to *recalibrate your power*.

In your work, you're innovative, analytical, and magnetically unorthodox. You thrive in spaces where intellect meets impact â€” where creativity isn't boxed in by outdated systems. You're not here to repeat the past. You're here to *redefine the future*.

In friendships and family, you're loyal, discerning, and quietly protective. You don't offer your inner world to just anyone â€” but when you do, it's sacred. You love in ways that are intentional, expansive, and always *authentic*.
