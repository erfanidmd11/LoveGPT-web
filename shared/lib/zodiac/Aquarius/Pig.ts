  fullNarrative: `
You are compassion with clarity â€” emotionally rich, intellectually curious, and loyal in a way that's both quiet and unwavering. You dream big, feel deeply, and live by your own compass. You don't seek to control love â€” you seek to *nurture* it.

In love, you are giving, thoughtful, and surprisingly deep. You crave connection that feels emotionally safe and mentally expansive. You want a partner who's kind, curious, and real â€” someone who sees the world as something to explore, not escape. You're loyal by default, romantic by nature, and driven more by feeling than formula.

You love through kindness, attentiveness, and emotional presence. You offer support without being asked and connection without conditions. But if your emotional generosity is abused or taken for granted? You don't confront with fire â€” you *fade*. With sadness, but also with self-respect.

In work, you're driven by meaning and humanity. You're most alive when building things that uplift, solve, or awaken. You might not chase power, but your purpose *leads*. You thrive when your intellect and heart get to collaborate â€” not compete.

With friends and family, you're loyal, nurturing, and emotionally available. You give without keeping score. You show up with presence, humor, and care â€” but as you grow, you learn that *reciprocity* is sacred too.

  fullNarrative: `
You are softness with strength â€” emotionally rich, deeply intuitive, and lovingly rebellious. You care deeply, but you won't conform to earn love. You seek connection that feels kind, conscious, and *aligned with your soul*, not your image.

In love, you are nurturing, visionary, and emotionally present. You give openly â€” but only when it feels real. You need a partner who respects your inner world, who meets your kindness with intention, and who understands that your sensitivity is not weakness â€” it's *power wrapped in presence*.

You love through care, depth, and unspoken understanding. You read between lines and feel what others can't articulate. But if your empathy is taken for granted, or your independence threatened? You *withdraw*. Not to punish â€” but to return to your *center*.

In work, you are imaginative, mission-driven, and emotionally intelligent. You thrive in roles that make an impact â€” where your values can lead and your vision can breathe. You don't chase authority â€” you *earn respect* through wisdom and compassion.

With friends and family, you're fiercely loyal, emotionally available, and profoundly loving. You show up when it matters. You listen between the words. But you're learning to protect your energy â€” because not everyone deserves your sacred emotional labor.
