  fullNarrative: `
You are quiet depth â€” a dreamer with logic, an outsider by choice, and a romantic who hides his tenderness behind a thoughtful pause. You don't need to be loud to be powerful â€” your presence speaks through purpose, not performance.

In love, you are sensitive, sincere, and emotionally discerning. You crave a partner who sees beyond your surface â€” who values your unconventional mind and your deeply held truths. You want someone who allows you to *breathe* emotionally, intellectually, and creatively â€” not someone who needs constant access to every layer.

You love through kindness, thoughtfulness, and emotional loyalty. You may not always express your feelings directly, but you *show up* in meaningful ways. You care deeply â€” often more than you let on. But if you feel emotionally dismissed, rushed, or misunderstood? You'll quietly *retreat* â€” not out of ego, but out of emotional necessity.

  fullNarrative: `
You are softness with steel â€” poetic, private, emotionally wise, and beautifully unconventional. You don't follow trends â€” you *channel truths*. You love deeply, but only when it feels like freedom. And you walk away â€” not in anger, but in clarity â€” when something asks you to shrink.

In love, you're emotionally rich, quietly loyal, and subtly discerning. You don't need grand gestures â€” you need emotional safety, creative connection, and *spiritual resonance*. You want a partner who can hold your tenderness without trying to manage it, who celebrates your complexity rather than simplifying it.

You love through creativity, kindness, and fierce presence. You might be slow to trust, but once you're in â€” you're *all in*. But if your emotions are dismissed, your energy is drained, or your space is disrespected? You don't explode. You *withdraw*. Fully. With grace, but with finality.

In work, you are intuitive, expressive, and values-driven. You thrive in environments where originality is currency, not risk. You build your own blueprint, and your power lies not in noise â€” but in quiet, steady conviction.

With friends and family, you are loyal, nurturing, and profoundly empathic. You feel everything â€” and often carry more than you show. You give deeply, but as you grow, you learn to pour from *overflow*, not depletion.
